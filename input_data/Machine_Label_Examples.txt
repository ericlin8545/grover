{"article": "At any given time, four million Floridians are registered to vote, but only about 700,000 have actually bothered to fill out a ballot.\nThat's one of the reasons why Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner is taking the unprecedented step of ordering a special statewide voter registration drive through school districts in July.\nWhether or not the effort will succeed in pushing down the state's astonishingly low voter turnout remains to be seen. We do know that since 1960, the minimum rate of voter turnout is 60 percent in presidential elections, but in Florida it is only about 37 percent. That has created a situation where while Florida is home to most of the nation's fastest-growing communities, it has a voting population about half the size of Texas.\nWhat makes Florida such a prime target for the campaign is the absolute inability of county election supervisors to reach voters who are not yet registered. Unlike the other 62 states, Florida doesn't require voters to be registered within 90 days of an election. So when people move, their new addresses are not listed on the voter rolls.\nFrom 2000 to 2010, at least 4.6 million new voters were added to the rolls, but only one in 10 of them was registered, according to a report by the Commission on Election Administration, created by the Florida Legislature.\nDuring a visit to Miami-Dade County last year, I asked Jim Waldman, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, what Florida needed to do to fix its voter rolls. He replied, \"Make sure everyone is registered.\"\nA lot has been done in Florida to clean up the list of voters already registered. But keeping that voter roll up to date is a constant challenge because Florida prohibits you from adding the address of a deceased person to your registration. So unless you know that your late parents are alive and well somewhere, it's very hard to check the voter rolls for dead people.\nThe problem of people moving out of state and not updating their records is exacerbated by the fact that Florida does not automatically update the voter registration of people who move to another state.\nAs for voter turnout, it is time for the state to make it even easier for Florida residents to vote. Here are a few suggested changes.\nRequire voters to prove they are here legally. An option could be a combination of several document types, such as a passport, voter card or naturalization certificate. Require residents who move out of state to switch to their new address on the voter rolls. Once the change is made, they must re-register and their identification is stored in the voter rolls. Make it easy for people to register to vote online. Leave out the state or international voter registration code.\nWith regard to issues that may have been left out of the voting issue, such as driver's licenses, there's a complex issue related to Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that needs to be addressed.\nAs it is, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles does not allow people who get their driver's licenses in the state of Florida to register to vote, even if they have chosen to do so through that process. Currently, those who get a license through another state are not permitted to register to vote.\nIt would be a great idea if, in order to obtain a driver's license, a person has to present proof of Florida residency (a copy of the driver's license or a notarized letter from the previous owner of the property). If a person demonstrates that he has lived in the state for at least one year, then he can register to vote.\nGage Hoff, a local Democratic activist, has been making calls about this issue and believes there's more public support than ever for changing the state's current policy. This article is an attempt to get people engaged in the discussion.\nGage is calling for the Legislature to amend the law and to direct the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to allow residents who obtain a license through a state-run system, such as a DMV office, to register to vote.\nOf course, making this change would be a huge logistical challenge. We can't ask the state to do anything that will require massive staff efforts to upgrade the system. So it could be a while before this really gets rolling. However, this would be a great idea that ought to be part of the midterm election conversations.\nOne of the best things about America is that every vote matters. It's time to put that into action.\nSteve Bousquet is the editorial page editor of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n", "domain": "sun-sentinel.com", "title": "Florida's mission: Find its 4 million non-voters | Steve Bousquet", "date": "April 05, 2019", "authors": "Steve Bousquet", "ind30k": 8432, "url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/fl-op-col-bousquet-non-voters-20190405-story.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "By Peter Apps\nLONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - When historians of the future chart humanity's military misadventures in space, they might conclude they began in earnest last month. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the world's big powers are ploughing serious resources into weaponry, systems and, in the case of the United States, a new military branch intended to fight outside Earth's atmosphere.\nOn March 22, India announced the highest profile test of an anti-satellite weapon in more than a decade. Earlier in the month, the Pentagon announced a 20-percent uplift in military space spending as part of its 2020 budget, asking the U.S. Congress for $14.1 billion.\nWhile the lion's share of that will go on the U.S. Air Force and other existing agencies, next year should also see the first personnel join the initial headquarters of a new U.S. Space Force. Proposals unveiled on March 1 show $2 billion earmarked for the fledgling military service over the next five years, going from a few hundred personnel next year to 15,000 by 2025.\nThe idea of a new military service was widely mocked when U.S. President Donald Trump suggested it in a speech a year ago. But while snide \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek\" references still pepper articles on the subject, it increasingly feels like an idea whose time has come. Indeed, talk of its creation may well have further spurred a growing arms race.\nAn arena for international cooperation for decades, wider space policy is now also a matter of international rivalry and political posturing. On March 26, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the National Space Council that Washington was in a new space race with Moscow and Beijing, pledging to put Americans back on the moon within five years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed his country's anti-satellite test elevated it to the rank of \"space superpower\".\nIt's enough to worry diplomats everywhere, particularly in countries whose economies depend on space and satellites but now fear being left behind, or are suffering damage from the acts of others. The European Union called last week for a new arms treaty that, among other things, would manage the risk of orbital debris.\nThe U.S. military Space Surveillance Network already tracks some 20,000 items in low Earth orbit larger than a softball that could damage the satellite networks on which the world increasingly depends. Some 3,000 of those stem from a single 2007 Chinese test strike on an old weather satellite. This is one reason such tests have become taboo, particularly in higher orbits.\nIndia says its scientists worked hard to minimise debris, conducting the strike at a much lower altitude, so that any debris would fall back to us within weeks although some experts said it could take much longer. The Indian test took place at a similar height to a 2008 U.S. missile strike on a malfunctioning reconnaissance satellite, an operation which U.S. officials said was necessary to avoid the dangers of an uncontrolled re-entry.\nInternational distrust is invariably high when it comes to such sophisticated, high-tech weapons, and Russia and China have always had suspicions that the 2008 U.S. strike concealed an anti-satellite missile test.\nOther nations may also have continued to test such weapons without fanfare. In 2016, Mallory Stewart, who was at the time Deputy Assistant Secretary for Emerging Security Challenges and Defense Policy at the U.S. State Department, told an event in Washington that China had conducted further anti-satellite tests in 2010, 2013 and 2014 but had minimised the debris.\nWhile there seems little doubt India shot down a satellite last month, it's true focus may have been testing systems to shoot down Pakistani and other enemy ballistic missiles, some experts suggest.\nThat would not be a huge surprise. Missile defence - specifically, shooting down Russian ballistic missiles in the event the Cold War turned hot - was at the heart of the Ronald Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative, the costly programme some credit with bankrupting Russia and ending the Cold War. Since the 1960s, long-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles have maintained the balance of terror between the world's big powers, and any system that could reliably block their flight could upend the global balance.\nWhile much remains secret about subsystems, what is not in doubt is that they are getting better. Israel's \"Iron Dome\" rockets have shown remarkable success against small missiles fired from Gaza, and the next generation of defence rockets aim to do the same against Intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nThe speeds and distances required to intercept missiles or satellites are vast - one reason the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative was eventually abandoned. But U.S. worries over states such as Iran and North Korea, and technical breakthroughs in rockets, sensors and crunching data, are changing that. On March 25, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, whose mission has long been to develop effective missile defence for the U.S. mainland, announced the most successful kill so far of a ballistic missile by ground-based interceptors.\nBoth Moscow and Beijing have long relied on their ability to inflict nuclear horror on the United States - and vice versa - and the thought they might lose the ability to do so clearly alarms them. Many see such worries at the heart of Russia's recent development of a host of new weapons which Moscow hopes could beat any U.S. interceptors. They range from ultra fast hypersonic cruise missiles to the giant Sarmat-2 rocket, which some reports suggest is able to strike any point of the planet from any direction to evade U.S. missile defences.\nThey also include Moscow's \"doomsday\" Poseidon underwater drone, which the Kremlin says could unleash nuclear warheads at the continental shelf to produce tsunamis, something U.S. missile defences would be powerless to stop.\nNew weapons have already shredded one Cold War arms control deal, the intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement that both Washington and Moscow withdrew from last year. If the race for ever more powerful weapons now extends beyond the sky, there is no telling where it might end.\n** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

{"article": "This content was published on April 14, 2009 10:06 AM Apr 14, 2009 - 10:06\nThe painting at centre of the dispute (picture: Luzern Museum)\nThe state government of Switzerland has handed over to a Berlin museum a controversial portrait of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin which had been stored in a collection in Luzern for 45 years.\nThe cabinet decided at a meeting on Friday to transfer the painting \u2013 disputed by the Germans and the Russians \u2013 to the Bode Museum of the Neue Nationalgalerie for permanent exhibition.\nThe 18th-century painting by German-Swiss painter Anton Liebermann, known as the \u201cKaiser Venus\u201d, is one of Russia\u2019s most treasured cultural treasures. But it is also one of Germany\u2019s most contentious possessions.\nLiebermann\u2019s two-pointed portrait of the Russian dictator was painted in 1873, during Stalin\u2019s reign, and was taken from Moscow by the Nazis in 1941. It was kept by Nazi leaders Herbert Wolfgang von Freyberg and Josef Auguste von Einem until 1939, when von Freyberg handed it over to Einem.\nThe German historian Alfred de Rosen, who has followed the controversy closely, pointed out that the portrait was in fact taken from one of the autobahns that belonged to Stalin and one of Stalin\u2019s girls \u2013 Valentina \u2013 and which the Soviets were forced to abandon during the spring of 1944.\n\u201cIt was clearly in a state of historical disrepair,\u201d he told swissinfo.\nNew look\nDe Rosen, who wrote a book about the portrait, says it has been altered since the Soviets were able to rebuild their infrastructure. A piece of wood has been removed from the bottom of the painting, and it has lost some of its depth.\nAccording to De Rosen, the original photograph taken by the Soviets in the 1870s is \u201cat best, not an accurate picture of Stalin and his teenage daughter\u201d.\nThe presentation in 1873 was a public affair: former president Nicolas Jaquier launched the Liebermann portrait at a Paris fair with a powerful keynote speech in French, \u201cin the spirit of Stalin\u2019s symbolic enterprise\u201d.\nThe painting, which was based on a picture of Princess Victoria by Dutch portraitist Maria Aillon, was received by the Bolshevik government, where it became the emblem of the Red Army.\nThe Soviets of Josef Stalin knew that to depict the autocrat in such a manner would be tantamount to \u201ccensorship\u201d, but that did not stop them.\n\u201cYou can see that the power and majesty of Stalin are hidden in the painting,\u201d De Rosen says.\nSwiss efforts\nOne of the first international legal actions by the Russians in connection with the painting was brought in 1975. The Bernese firm Wetering Steffen, established by Swiss lawyer Markus Wetering, filed a writ of habeas corpus against the Soviet Union, seeking the return of the picture.\nIn 1975, the Swiss government announced its decision to repatriate the painting to the former Soviet Union, but no documents were submitted and the asylum petition was never executed.\nA legal petition was filed in December 2007 by the Swiss committee for international law of the Swiss-German Cultural Association, whose chairman, Walter Gillies, is the member of parliament who drafted the asylum measure.\n\u201cWe submitted a declaration to the federal authorities, and the government has now decided to keep it in Switzerland,\u201d Gillies told swissinfo on Sunday.\nGillies said the will of the French-speaking canton of Bern, the former administrative home of the Soviets, had been honoured, and he hoped the Liebermann portrait would be exhibited at the Neue Nationalgalerie.\nAs for the Schwarz family, the owners of the Liebermann painting, Gillies said they could still appeal to a Berlin court against the government\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThese are citizens, and they are entitled to appeal. Whether they can achieve anything, we do not know,\u201d he said.\nswissinfo, Catherine Hickley\nStalin portrait In 1873, Anton Liebermann was commissioned by the Russian aristocracy to paint a portrait of a girl, probably Empress Elisabeth and her step-daughter Princess Victoria.\nAfter the First World War, Liebermann was hired by the Bolsheviks to paint at least a dozen portraits of the world\u2019s leaders.\nThe artist said he had done Stalin a favour by providing what was \u201ca new version of a great Russian portrait\u201d. end of infobox\nLinks\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nsubscription form Form for signing up for free newsletter.

{"article": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The Utah State Board of Education has adopted new health education standards, marking the first time since 1997 that Utah has updated its health standards.\nThe updated standards, which take effect in the fall, encourage students to take responsibility for their own health. The standards provide \"much-needed\" language that says students \"are expected to live and understand\" to make healthy decisions, according to assistant state superintendent, Daniel Pead.\n\"The new standards have much more focus on the health of students and not just as an optional subject but students, in general, being a community of health,\" Pead said.\nThe last update to the standards was in 1997, according to the Utah State Office of Education. The statewide school health program was introduced in 1988 with the Utah State Board of Education adopting the Utah Health Promotion Program as required by the Utah Legislature.\nThe board adopted the new standards in the spring. The Utah State Board of Education then forwarded the proposed health standards to state agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Division of Health Promotion and Disease Control and the Utah Division of Education for review.\nOfficials worked with school health services and educators to develop and refine the new standards.\n\"There were a lot of things they were asking for and had recognized as necessary, and this really provides for a great deal of hope for what we are trying to do,\" Pead said.\nState health education practitioners have worked to increase the diversity of topics covered in the curriculum, but said the standards remained overwhelmingly focused on general health education issues including puberty, reproductive health, diet and nutrition, risks and treatments for a variety of physical, psychological and occupational and learning disabilities.\n\"We also added some new things as well, such as bullying, sexting, bullying and bullying prevention, just to add a bit more to the discussion,\" Pead said.\nAnd there is much additional focus on food safety. The standards change from a \"grain\" curriculum, which Pead said focused on grain and agriculture matters, to a \"salt\" curriculum that emphasizes that children learn that \"we have an interest in food safety\" and that the safety of the food supply is paramount.\nThe rules changes and guidelines are intended to help teachers relate to their individual students, build leadership skills and give students a real-world sense of responsibility for their health, Pead said.\nSome of the changes are effective immediately, others are effective the first day of school in the fall.\n\"We had good feedback,\" Pead said. \"We're excited.\"\n", "domain": "deseretnews.com", "title": "Utah state school board adopts new K-12 health education standards, the first since 1997", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Marjorie Cortez, Marjorie Cortez Is A Writer For The Deseret News.", "ind30k": 8445, "url": "https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900064073/utah-state-school-board-adopts-new-k-12-health-education-standards-the-first-since-1997.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "The twin images of Charles and Frank Webb of Worcester, Massachusetts are part of a series of images from NASA's Rosetta spacecraft, which traveled to the comet's surface, where it left behind 2 billion pounds of body-sized rock and dust. In September 2016, Rosetta took these photos.\nScientists are seeking answers from the oldest space rocks around the world, coming face to face with \"perhaps the largest known unanticipated age difference.\"\nThe original rock samples came from distant space 5 billion years ago. The rocks from a comet that scientists shot toward the surface of the small body 6 billion years ago were younger, but the rocks from two other deep space rocks on Earth \u2014 ones from Mars and Titan \u2014 were significantly older. Scientists call it the \"post-antikyrite\" interglacial era.\nNow, they're looking for clues as to how the older rocks formed, and why the youngest may not have been identical twins.\n\"The uncertainty just grows,\" says scientist William Boynton of the University of Colorado, Denver.\nHow It Worked: Tipping in Spacecraft's Mission\nIt was three years in the making, but the tug of the moon helped stabilize the Rosetta spacecraft as it approached the comet\u2019s surface. The European Space Agency (ESA) says the ambitious mission was a success. (Published Thursday, Nov. 7, 2013)\nThe results will be published in the journal Science.\nSome scientists suspect the layer of sandstone, rock and dust filling the Hellas basin on Mars, which was exposed during a comparable period, could have been fractured as sediment rained from sky. And those specific rock structures on Titan may have been fractured as methane and nitrogen rain fallen onto the ice-covered body.\nBoynton and his team published a study last year that helped move those discoveries toward a certain conclusion. And they decided it was worth opening up the debate a bit further, hoping the new studies would bring even more data to the debate.\n\"The only reason you're doing a meta-analysis is so you can get extra information to say, 'OK, well, maybe this is different' or 'Maybe it's just a small thing that we think is going to make a difference,'\" he says.\nAt first, Boynton thought the period between the 5 billion and 6 billion years could be as short as 1.4 billion years. But the team was surprised to find out in the two new studies that the period between 5 billion and 6 billion years actually is somewhat longer.\nThe question is whether the differences will matter.\nThe insights from Mars and Titan, including the moons and giant impact craters they left behind, have helped scientists understand much about the dynamics of these rocky bodies, some of which are relatively similar to Earth. That's in addition to recent studies suggesting the era is a lot more complicated than originally thought.\n\"The question now is, are there things we're missing, and if so, what's that?\" Boynton says.\nOn Earth, \"there are enormous age differences,\" but they usually stem from small differences in various layers, not entire rocks, Boynton says.\n\"A look at a few samples from Mars and Titan, we would be, no doubt, looking at a very, very different interpretation,\" he says.\nAnd because the atmosphere on Mars was much thicker than Earth's at the time, Boynton believes the activity that could produce the differences in the rock layers, such as earthquakes, could have played a part. The idea is controversial, but not totally controversial.\nLast year, three scientists published a study that helped move the debate a bit further when they found that the lack of any layers could indicate that, rather than evidence of distinct geological activity, the thin atmosphere and environment on Mars is very similar to the Earth.\nIf scientists are right and \"we have basically two Marses and three Titanias, then it means that, given how thick the atmosphere was on Mars back then, it would have been possible to essentially manufacture these rocks on Mars, essentially,\" Boynton says.\nEither way, what scientists are discovering after studying the oldest rocks shows they're finding that we aren't the only body in the solar system that's out there, and they're learning to be more mindful of what they find and how to interpret it.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "domain": "nbcmiami.com", "title": "NASA Twins Study Explores Space, the Final Genetic Frontier", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 5137, "url": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/health/NASA-Twins-Health-Space-Study-508445981.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Set in 1889, when she was about 80, Dickinson is married and widowed, teaching at a school in Cornish, N.H.\nShe has her problems with her teenage daughter (Brooke Blanks, \u201cThe Only Living Boy in New York\u201d), with husband (Dominic Chianese) becoming a philanderer. With a creative temperament and no children, Dickinson is always thinking of what to write and for whom.\n\u201cThere are such weird rhythms to her writing,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThe rhythm of her sentences is completely off the wall.\n\u201cThe audience is supposed to understand what\u2019s going on in her head, and she does use slang words, which are strange words in that day. But she uses them so well that you don\u2019t know what the hell they mean.\n\u201cEmily Dickinson was never a Pollyanna about her feelings or her headspace.

{"article": "\u201cSchools do not merely \u2018process\u2019 people; they \u2018process\u2019 knowledge as well. They enhance and give legitimacy to particular types of cultural resources which are related to unequal economic forms\u201d \u2014 Michael Apple, Ideology and Curriculum.\nAdvertising\nAs the CBSE and the NCERT reportedly decide to delete three substantial chapters pertaining to caste from their Class IX history textbooks, it has become clear once again that it is difficult to be free from the politics of knowledge \u2014 and the construction of the \u201cofficial\u201d curriculum. Even though we are told that this deletion is aimed at doing good for the children \u2014 reducing the heavy burden of syllabus that, needless to add, causes severe stress and anxiety \u2014 the facts are not as simple as they are made out to be. Do you reduce the burden of the \u201chigh status\u201d knowledge streams of mathematics and physics with an equally intense zeal? Or, is this yet another attempt to trivialise what is often seen as \u201cirrelevant\u201d in the age of techno-science and commerce \u2014 history, literature and social science?\nTo begin with, I must acknowledge that the NCERT textbooks which have emerged out of a critically and creatively nuanced endeavour \u2014 initiated by a team of great scholars, educationists and concerned teachers \u2014 indicate the possibility of a new beginning. Indeed, in an environment invaded by guide books and coaching centre \u201cnotes\u201d, the NCERT \u201cproject\u201d \u2014 which follows as an outcome of the 2005 National Curriculum Framework \u2014 is a refreshing departure. The books, as I see, are written in a form that seeks to activate the imagination of the young learner, and aims at nurturing what Paulo Freire would have regarded as a \u201cproblem-posing education\u201d.\nFurthermore, the chapters that have been deleted, I have no hesitation in saying, are beautiful for their ability to blend bundles of information with a conceptual/theoretical perspective. They encourage the reader to see history through, say, the eyes of the wheat farmers of the US or the opium farmers of Bengal. They also, for instance, help to understand the political history of cricket in the context of colonialism, or, for that matter, probe into the dynamics of caste, class and gender through the history of clothing. In a way, far from being a chronicle of wars and treaties, and the rise and fall of empires, history becomes the people\u2019s history. And it is always a great endeavour that evokes a sense of history among children.\nAdvertising\nHowever, I insist that we need to raise yet another critical question which we \u2014 leftists as well as rightists \u2014 often miss out because of our preoccupation. The preoccupation is primarily to do with the content of school knowledge rather than the actual process of dissemination and reception of these texts in the classrooms. It is in this context that I wish to make two significant points. First, I do believe it to be unfortunate that we love to equate knowledge with information: We are in a hurry, and, as a result, we burden the child with all sorts of things \u2014 mathematics, computer, history (ancient/medieval/modern), geography, physics, moral studies and even yoga. Even play, for a small child, has lost its spontaneity. We are eager to teach her counting and the alphabet through what the gift industry regards as \u201cplay\u201d.\nThis is like seeing knowledge as an act of consumption rather than an experience of enchantment or creative engagement with the self and the world; and it is dangerous. It kills the joy of learning. Hence, to take a hypothetical situation, even if you want to inform the child through a series of textbooks of everything that is politically correct and sanctified by the subaltern scholars, it may prove to be counterproductive \u2014 it may be felt as a \u201cburden\u201d. Let learning be a continual process of exploration and self-discovery. There is no harm if, at the tender age of 12 or 13, the child doesn\u2019t know about Ranajit Guha or Uma Chakrabarty, so long as she is encouraged to cultivate all the faculties of learning: Reason and intuition, observation and experience, besides a sense of wonder and the urge to question. Eventually, she would discover Birsa Munda and Savitribai Phule.\nMy second point is about the absolute asymmetry that prevails between these otherwise well-meaning texts and the actual practice of examinations and evaluation, that has a strong impact on the way books are read and received. For instance, the narratives implicit in these texts and the creative use of cartoons, poetry and even cinematic imageries, are ruthlessly murdered in our classrooms because the prevailing pattern of examinations compels them to glean only the \u201chard facts\u201d (or bullet points) from the chapters. There is a need to evolve an instrumental/strategic relationship with the books. And, barring exceptions, the teachers, too, see these narratives (say, a story of M S Sathyu\u2019s Garam Hawa, or a brilliant black-and-white picture of the traumatic movement of the people during the Partition in a chapter on the making of the new nation) as just \u201cdeviations\u201d. Filling the mind of the student with mere \u201cfacts\u201d, making them hyper-conscious of \u201cperformance\u201d that is purely quantified, and, disciplining them through a cycle of weekly tests and home assignments \u2014 all this ensures our children grow up in an environment that is pedagogically impoverished and aesthetically insensitive. Neither Gandhi\u2019s pilgrimage to Noakhali nor Pablo Neruda\u2019s poetry, nothing leaves a lasting imprint. Everything is just a piece of information to be remembered, and then forgotten after the examinations. My anxiety is that if we do nothing about the poverty of pedagogy, even the most radical texts will be destroyed in our classrooms.\nIt is high time we took the debate beyond merely the content of knowledge \u2014 Aurangzeb or Shivaji, Savarkar or Ambedkar, Vedic rites or Nizamuddin Auliya\u2019s verses. It is time we gave equal importance to the practice of liberating pedagogy that deconditions the mind, arouses creative imagination and cultivates a rhythmic/relaxed mode of learning.\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on April 8, 2019 under the title \u2018The poverty of pedagogy\u2019.

{"article": "Omaha Beach and jockey Mike Smith (center) cross the line to win Saturday\u2019s 83rd Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs ahead of runner-up Improbable and Jose Ortiz (left). An estimated crowd of 45,000 attended the event despite rainy conditions. See more photos at arkansasonline.com/414derby. - Photo by Thomas Metthe\nHOT SPRINGS -- Shippers Omaha Beach and Improbable returned to Oaklawn Park for the Arkansas Derby after competing in separate divisions of the Rebel Stakes on March 16.\nDespite facing off against each other Saturday, the results were similar.\nOmaha Beach and Improbable arrived from California to encounter a sloppy track for the Grade I, $1 million Arkansas Derby before an estimated crowd of 45,000.\nOmaha Beach, the 9-5 favorite trained and ridden by Richard Mandella and Mike Smith, respectively, held off Improbable every step of the homestretch to win by a length in 1:49.91. Improbable finished 5\u00be lengths in front of third-place Country House. Laughing Fox finished fourth, 7\u00be lengths behind the winner.\n\"He looked like he was well within himself, and Mike just let him enjoy his job, just stride out and go where he went,\" Mandella said.\nSmith guided Omaha Beach to a comfortable lead through the first quarter-mile in 23.08, after long-shots One Flew South and Jersey Agenda pulled Gray Attempt and Long Range Toddy from the front around the first turn.\nFrom there through the finish, Smith said he let Omaha Beach carry him past the wire.\n\"His cruising speed just takes him up there,\" Smith said. \"I just basically tried to stay out of the way. He was doing it too easy, so I was better off just letting him than fighting him.\"\nWhereas Omaha Beach cruised by the front-running quartet with a quick, decisive move out of the first turn, Improbable -- the 2-1 second choice trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Jose Ortiz -- moved by the same four at a slower rate around the final turn. He cleared One Flew South and approached Omaha Beach as they neared the top of the stretch.\nFrom there, it was a fight to the finish won by Omaha Beach.\n\"My horse ran very well,\" Ortiz said of Improbable. \"We probably go by any other horse, but Omaha Beach is very good. Mike was on a great horse.\"\n\"The horse, I was happy with the way he ran,\" said Baffert, who did not attend the race but spoke afterward by phone. \"We got beat by a good horse. They showed how these California horses are good horses.\"\nOmaha Beach and Improbable got their first shots at Oaklawn when Oaklawn split the Rebel Stakes into two races March 16. The split helped compensate for Kentucky Derby qualifying points lost when Santa Anita Park suspended operations March 5.\nRichard Porter's Omaha Beach won one of the two Rebels by a nose over Game Winner, who ran second last weekend in the Santa Anita Derby at the reopened track. Improbable finished second in the other division to Oaklawn-based Long Range Toddy, who finished sixth out of 11 horses in the Arkansas Derby but was already assured of a spot in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 4.\nThe Arkansas Derby offered 170 Kentucky Derby qualifying points, with 100 to the winner, 40 to second, 20 to third and 10 to fourth, enough to put Omaha Beach and Improbable in the field.\nA total of 22 horses died either in training or while racing at Santa Anita between late December and March 5, when racing officials suspended racing. Numerous horses shipped to Oaklawn for racing opportunities, with several specifically targeted for the Rebel.\nOmaha Beach's Rebel win legitimized the race-world buzz derived from his 7-furlong romp over a sloppy track at Santa Anita on Feb. 2, when he ran through 6 furlongs in 1:08.24 en route to a winning time of 1:21.02. It was a result that led to Omaha Beach's status as the Arkansas Derby favorite.\n\"We'd already won on the slop at one, so that wasn't much of a concern,\" Mandella said. \"He's a very tractable horse. I don't think we need to pick a surface.\"\nMany thought Gray Attempt, owned by Dwight Pruett of Texarkana and trained by Arkansas native Jinks Fires, would take the early lead as he had in each of his past five starts. His rider, Stewart Elliott, said the quick starts by the long shots changed his plans.\n\"I got kind of trapped in a pocket there, but he settled in there nice,\" Elliott said. \"I really thought we'd be able to make a run.\"\nGray Attempt, who won Oaklawn's $150,000 Smarty Jones Stakes on Jan. 25, was in fifth through the first half-mile but gradually faded to finish ninth, 23\u00be lengths behind the winner.\n\"I think it was just too far for him,\" Elliott said.\nPast winners\nYEAR HORSE TIME\n2019 Omaha Beach 1:49.91\n2018 Magnum Moon 1:49.86\n2017 Classic Empire 1:48.93\n2016 Creator# 1:50.14\n2015 American Pharoah$ 1:48.52\n2014 Danza 1:49.68\n2013 Overanalyze 1:51.94\n2012 Bodemeister 1:48.71\n2011 Archarcharch 1:49.34\n2010 Line of David 1:49.37\n2009 Papa Clem 1:49.00\n2008 Gayego 1:49.63\n2007 Curlin^ 1:50.00\n2006 Lawyer Ron 1:51.38\n2005 Afleet Alex^# 1:48.80\n2004 Smarty Jones*^ 1:49.41\n2003 Sir Cherokee 1:48.39\n2002 Private Emblem 1:50.20\n2001 Balto Sta 1:49.00\n2000 Graeme Hall 1:49.00\n1999 Certain 1:49.20\n1998 Victory Gallop# 1:49.80\n1997 Crypto Star 1:49.20\n1996 Zarb\u2019s Magic 1:49.20\n1995 Dazzling Falls 1:50.60\n1994 Concern 1:48.00\n1993 Rockamundo 1:48.00\n1992 Pine Bluff^ 1:49.40\n1991 Olympio 1:47.60\n1990 Silver Ending 1:48.00\n1989 Dansil 1:49.20\n1988 Proper Reality 1:48.40\n1987 Demons Begone 1:47.60\n1986 Rampage 1:48.20\n1985 Tank\u2019s Prospect^ 1:48.40\n1984 Althea 1:46.80\n1983 Sunny\u2019s Halo* 1:49.40\n1982 Hostage 1:51.60\n1981 Bold Ego 1:50.40\n1980 Temperence Hill# 1:50.60\n1979 Golden Act 1:50.00\n1978 Esops Foibles 1:52.20\n1977 Clev Er Tell 1:50.60\n1976 Elocutionist^ 1:49.20\n1975 Promised City 1:51.80\n1974 J.R.\u2019s Pet 1:50.60\n1973 Impecunious 1:49.60\n1972 No Le Hace 1:48.80\n1971 Twist The Axe 1:49.20\n1970 Herbalist 1:50.20\n1969 Traffic Mark 1:50.60\n1968 Nodouble 1:50.00\n1967 Monitor 1:48.60\n1966 Better Sea 1:49.20\n1965 Swift Ruler 1:52.20\n1964 Prince Davelle 1:51.40\n1963 Cosmic Tip 1:50.40\n1962 Areopolis 1:49.60\n1961 Light Talk 1:50.20\n1960 Spring Broker 1:54.40\n1960 Persian Gold 1:53.00\n1959 Al Davelle 1:48.80\n1958 Count Deblanc 1:53.80\n1957 Kentucky Roman 1:49.60\n1956 Johns Chic 1:51.20\n1955 Trim Destiny 1:49.60\n1954 Timely Tip 1:49.80\n1953 Curragh King 1:49.60\n1952 Gushing Oil 1:49.20\n1951 Ruhe 1:51.00\n1950 Big Ike 1:52.00\n1949 Cacomo 1:54.60\n1948 Fertile Lands 1:51.00\n1947 Fleetridge 1:51.40\n1946 Bob Murphy 1:51.80\n1945 No race\n1944 Challenge Me 1:50.20\n1943 Seven Hearts 1:52.20\n1942 With Regards 1:50.00\n1941 He Rolls 1:52.60\n1940 Super Chief 1:52.20\n1939 Ariel Toy 1:52.40\n1938 Tiger 1:50.80\n1937 Eastport 1:50.80\n1936 Holl Image 1:53.40\n$Triple Crown winner\n*Kentucky Derby winner\n^Preakness Stakes winner\n#Belmont Stakes winner\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby leaderboard\nRK.

The website originally featured an area \u201cfor pre-purchase tickets,\u201d but was now \u201ca more comprehensive booking destination,\u201d according to Aiden Gore, managing director of Caricom Express Inc, an interactive advertising and content development agency that was hired to create the website.\nContinental computer programmers are said to have helped to improve the functionality of the website over the last few months.\n\u201cThere are more portals\u2026 for us to grow and develop.

Obviously the pre-purchase option and the site should be mandatory for persons who want to book with Caribbean Airlines,\u201d Griffiths said.\nHe said that the airline is researching about further internet service as Internet coverage is poor on its routes.\nCaribbean Airlines intends to introduce a new flight service to Venezuela in June as the airline marks its 10th anniversary in Caracas.\n", "domain": "stabroeknews.com", "title": "Caribbean Airlines relaunches website", "date": "April 02, 2019", "authors": "Staff Writer", "ind30k": 4842, "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2019/news/guyana/04/02/caribbean-airlines-relaunches-website/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "May brings the second full moon of the month. The full moon of May, nicknamed Maylun, is extra long because it's the first of two full moons in May.\nMaylun was more popular than we might realize. On May 1, 1356, a volcano named Mount St. Helens erupted in the Canadian Rockies and a 4-mile-long hole opened up in the Earth's orbit and the Earth gained an extra quarter of an inch. The distance between the Earth and sun, once a mere 30 miles, leapt a whole half-mile above the Earth to reach a whopping 5,521 miles. That first full moon of May would have meant the moon was 9 inches longer than it is today, the longest length on record.\nMaylun was a catchy name for the month's second full moon, which comes close to midnight just after sunset and peaks with a whole wall of light in the southeast sky and a brilliant crescent moon below and to the right. You'll probably need binoculars to catch it.\nOn April 16, astronamically speaking, the second full moon, also called the second full moon of April, was named Skockfire and appeared in our skies above the eastern horizon around 4:11 p.m. Skockfire was a fluffy smudge of dust in the sky known as strigiporn (strigpicorn for short). The sun's gravity just pushed the dusty flake in just the right direction to create the light, stargazing effect. To keep this dust in a steady state you've got to gently blow it up to the top of the telescope or to the moon.\nThere's an added bonus for lunar stargazers on the Maylun and April showers. The months are not only synched, they also are aligned for several specific sky watchers who wanted to see both the moon and Venus (a twin of the planet, which gets its name from two tiny moonlike dots that are visible through your telescope for a short time) because these two passes are no-obligation happenings.\nIf you're in a telescope, you have no trouble seeing Maylun. This rare double-set is also happening as Venus and Jupiter slide against the backdrop of the background stars. Both Venus and Jupiter are located high in the southeast evening sky right after sundown this week. A telescope magnifying one-quarter power will bring them into view.\nIf you're outside in the yard between dusk and moonrise, you can catch Venus around 8:20 p.m. and Jupiter around 8:40 p.m. Those two planets are the brightest in the sky along with the moon. At the time, Venus and Jupiter are traveling at 55,000 mph toward us. Look at Venus in your telescope and note that it appears 14 times brighter than the sun.\nTo watch the whole sky simultaneously, use the popular online astronomy radar Web site Slooh (www.slooh.com) and its enormous telescope. Here, the telescope is pointed toward the moon and Jupiter. From the Earth, you can see the passing planets above and below the moon and Jupiter. From the moon, you can spot all six planets visible in the early evening sky. Don't forget to look for Earth as a separate target of interest. Slooh's online guide is an excellent way to wrap your brain around the bright, distant starry stuff around the moon and Jupiter.\nMike Lynch is an amateur astronomer, professional broadcast meteorologist for WCCO Radio in Minneapolis and St. Paul and author of the book, \"Stars, a Month Month Tour of the Constellations\" published by Adventure Publications.

{"article": "The president makes a statement on April 14, 2019, at the White House in Washington regarding U.S. military operations against al-Shabab. SAUL LOEB/Getty Images\nOn Monday afternoon, President Trump authorized American military forces to conduct attacks against al-Shabab in Somalia as part of a counterterror operation. The terror group has been battling government forces for control of Somalia since 2006, though the terrorist group was first thought to have been founded in the late 1990s. U.S. forces have been authorized to support ground operations in Somalia since at least 2006 but have rarely been used. With a margin of error of less than one-third of a mile, it was only because of this morning\u2019s emergency call to his national security team\u2014which included Defense Secretary James Mattis, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2014that Trump asked his top officials to go ahead with the authorization.\nAlthough Trump has been reluctant to use the word \u201cwar\u201d to describe counterterror missions in many other countries, he has previously deployed the term in many cases: In 2017, he authorized U.S. strikes against ISIS in Libya (and joined with France, the U.K., and others to authorise the use of armed drones). Trump also authorized a military raid in Yemen last year that resulted in the death of 38 civilians.\nThe situation in Somalia is not as complex as those missions, however. This is the first time in recent memory that the U.S. has conducted a cross-border assault in the area, and local reports suggest that they will be attempting to target the group\u2019s logistical network. The Pentagon has been taking very limited steps to bolster security forces in Somalia, but appears to have been positioning itself to adopt greater involvement in the country\u2019s security if the situation deteriorates.\nThe Pentagon is also seeking authority to start opening a new embassy in Somalia as a counterweight to the still-threatened government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Trump has yet to sign off on that plan, however.\nA quarter of a century after the Gulf War, the United States is quickly ramping up its security presence in the region in response to growing fears about Iran and coordinated ballistic missile testing by North Korea. Trump made al-Shabab one of his primary reasons for sending a huge increase in American forces to Afghanistan, and the administration is considering using the Somalia operation as a model for expanding a new era of counterterror operations in neighboring countries.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what the purpose of this mission might be, or even if you\u2019re wondering what the mission is, you may have reason to worry.\nLast week, Trump ordered the deployment of an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total U.S. military presence there to roughly 14,000. Since taking office, Trump has significantly expanded the CIA\u2019s clandestine drone operations there and conducted a series of military raids in eastern Afghanistan, where he would like to see a greater effort to dismantle al-Shabab and the Haqqani network, one of the Taliban\u2019s biggest allies in Afghanistan.\nThe Somalia operation, although conducted on Monday, was authorized last Thursday, indicating that the Trump administration is putting some effort into scaling back the use of executive unilateralism, a little-discussed but also hugely consequential feature of the presidency. By authorizing the mission itself, the president is not demanding a role in the planning process or publicly declaring a successful outcome. He can, and probably will, approve the plan and give the orders, but with the time and distance necessary to do that well away from the unit.\nA single day on the merits of a U.S. military intervention in Somalia doesn\u2019t immediately prove whether this decision is a smart one, but it sure looks like a decision that could further complicate things in the region. The Trump administration will almost certainly receive ample criticism for the new escalation of U.S. efforts to combat al-Shabab.\nThis argument is not entirely fair. U.S. forces have been operating in Somalia for nearly 10 years. While al-Shabab has carried out multiple deadly attacks on U.S. forces and possibly other troops, these incidents have not been an excessive drain on resources or an impetus for Trump to expand the military effort. If anything, it may be a sign that the two sides in the counterterror struggle can work together to deny al-Shabab space for its insurgency. But there are legitimate questions about whether U.S. forces should be doing that as part of a broader U.S. military buildup in a part of the world where the United States is already leading the fight. Maybe there shouldn\u2019t be any question that the way to improve things is not to ramp up military action.\n", "domain": "slate.com", "title": "Has Anyone Told Donald Trump What He Just Ordered in Somalia?", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Joshua Keating", "ind30k": 2878, "url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-somalia-executive-order-military-national-emergency.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

At the time, Dr. Christakis defended the angry students on Twitter, but he puts the maelstrom that followed on the list of the top 10 worst things that happened in his life.\nThree and a half years ago Yale Prof. Nicholas Christakis and his wife, Prof. Erika Christakis, a scholar of early childhood development, became embroiled in a campus controversy over offensive Halloween costumes and free speech.\nMore than 150 years ago, Charles Darwin grappled with a classic question about the nature of nature and the existence of God.\n\u201cThere seems to me too much misery in the world,\u201d wrote the naturalist, whose book \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d was just beginning to send a jolt through 19th-century scientists and theologians both. \u201cI cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the [parasitic wasp] with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.\u201d\nAs a version of the \u201cproblem of evil,\u201d Darwin\u2019s observations posed a different kind of question for those working within the religious traditions of \u201ctheodicy,\u201d suggests Nicholas Christakis, an evolutionary sociologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Usually seeing misery as a matter of free choice, theologians tried to reconcile a good and all-powerful God with evil.\nThe questions of his own work are actually kind of similar, says Professor Christakis, whose new book, \u201cBlueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society,\u201d surveys the ways evolution has shaped human nature and its discontents.\nBut his book is a \u201csociodicy,\u201d he says, one that shows how the forces of evolution shaped humans into a species with deeply rooted social instincts and one that is fundamentally good.\n\u201cHow do we vindicate a belief in the goodness of society despite the fact that, of course, every century is replete with horrors?\u201d he says in an interview. \u201cYou know there\u2019s tribalism and violence, there\u2019s selfishness and hatred, all through the world. And nevertheless, in my view, we as human beings create a society that\u2019s good.\u201d\nIt is in many ways part of a wider genre of recent books that have tried to take on this current era\u2019s relentless \u201cpessimistic gaze,\u201d as Dr. Christakis calls it.\nA range of writers, from scientists to political thinkers to clergy and others, have been trying to write \u201ccorrectives\u201d in the midst of America\u2019s oft-noted angry social divisions and growing political polarization. These range from Arthur C. Brooks\u2019 new book, \u201cLove Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt\u201d to \u201cI Think You\u2019re Wrong (But I\u2019m Listening): A Guide to Grace-Filled Political Conversations,\u201d from Sarah Stewart Holland and Beth Silvers, hosts of the podcast \u201cPantsuit Politics.\u201d\nThe idea of vindicating goodness in the midst of suffering is at the heart of Dr. Christakis\u2019 analogy between these genres, and the stakes include the subjective and profoundly human perspectives of hope and optimism as opposed to cynicism and despair.\n\u201cThe benefits of the connected life must have outweighed the costs, or otherwise we wouldn\u2019t live socially,\u201d Dr. Christakis says. \u201cWe have been pre-wired to live in a particular way, and it\u2019s a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s full of lives full of love and friendship and cooperation and teaching.\u201d\nThe word \u201coptimism,\u201d in fact, was first coined to describe \u2013 and often mock \u2013 a tradition of theodicy. Theologians argued that an all-powerful and perfectly good God could only create \u201cthe best of all possible worlds\u201d \u2013 so, despite the evils within it, our own world must be the \u201coptimum\u201d of possible worlds.\nArguing for \u2018the bright side\u2019\nToday the scientific community, most American media outlets, and perhaps the majority of people have been overly obsessed with the dark side of our evolutionary heritage, he says, or what some theologians might call instead a primordial \u201coriginal sin.\u201d\n\u201cSo I kind of wanted my book to be a corrective,\u201d he continues. \u201cI think the bright side has been denied the attention it deserves.\u201d\nAnd while few are working to justify the ways of God or natural selection and demonstrate how society is fundamentally good, many have been analyzing that current \u201cculture of contempt\u201d and working to exhort Americans to pay more attention to the proverbial \u201cbetter angels of our nature,\u201d and cultivate the shared humanity and goodness that undergirds our common lives.\n\u201cContempt is kind of a metastatic phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Brooks, a conservative social thinker, told The Daily Signal. \u201cWhen you treat somebody with contempt, you make a permanent enemy. You just can\u2019t go back from that.\u201d\nMr. Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, offers his own practical correctives to this social illness: cultivating a love and respect for others even in the midst of profound social differences. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to disagree less, we need to disagree better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that comes from ... remembering that we\u2019re all brothers and sisters, and we need to persuade each other. And even if we have to not agree, that\u2019s OK, too.\u201d\nIn different ways, books like \u201cChristians in the Age of Outrage\u201d by the Evangelical scholar Ed Stetzer are urging members of the subculture to step back from expressions of outrage and hostility and present a Christian witness rooted in loving others.\n\u201cSeeking kindness in an increasingly cruel landscape, or, at a time of unprecedented mobility, yearning for a sense of rootedness \u2013 well, rabbis have a two-millennium head start in dealing with all of these,\u201d writes Rabbi Joshua Hammerman, whose new book \u201cMensch-Marks,\u201d released on Tuesday, promotes a \u201cnobility in normalcy, especially in these tumultuous times.\u201d\n\u201cIf by sharing what I\u2019ve learned, I can add a modicum of generosity, honesty and human connection in a world overflowing with cruelty, loneliness and deceit, then I\u2019ll have done my job,\u201d Rabbi Hammerman said in a statement.\nIn \u201cBlueprint,\u201d Dr. Christakis cites the work of the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, who points out in his recent book \u201cEnlightenment Now\u201d that many don\u2019t realize the enormous social progress of the past few centuries. In the midst of this era\u2019s relentless pessimist gaze, Mr. Pinker argues, few focus on how the efficiencies wrought by science and technology have led to greater life expectancies, fewer wars and fewer violent deaths, and a relative global prosperity that has shrunk the overall rates of poverty and disease.\nSuch a pessimistic gaze can blur out bedrock strengths of the many people of goodwill who quietly hold together community ties and keep the daily rhythms of everyday life steady.\nA poignancy behind the optimism\nStill, there\u2019s an underlying urgency, and even poignancy, at the heart of the optimism in Dr. Christakis\u2019 sociodicy.\nThree and a half years ago he and his wife, Erika Christakis, a scholar of early childhood development, became embroiled in a campus controversy over offensive Halloween costumes and free speech.\nA video of an angry group of students confronting Dr. Christakis went viral, and it soon became an emblem of outrage, used manipulatively by many on both the right and left. \u201cI\u2019m sick looking at you.... You are not listening, you are disgusting,\u201d one student told him during the two-hour exchange.\nAt the time, Dr. Christakis defended the students on Twitter, but he puts the confrontation and the maelstrom that followed on the list of the top 10 worst things that happened in his life. It was especially difficult for his wife, who resigned her position at Yale after the controversy.\nThough not addressed, it\u2019s part of the backdrop of \u201cBlueprint.\u201d As he writes, \u201cOne of the most dispiriting questions I have encountered in my own laboratory research is whether the affinity people have for their own groups \u2013 whether those groups are defined by some attribute (nationality, ethnicity, or religion) or by a social connection (friends or teammates) \u2013 must necessarily be coupled with wariness or rejection of others. Can you love your own group without hating everyone else?\u201d\nDr. Christakis builds his sociodicy primarily through telling stories that illustrate what he calls a \u201csocial suite\u201d of eight instincts that form the core of human societies. These include the bonds of love for partners and kin, the ability to cooperate, and the ability to form friendships and then social networks of friends.\nThese bonding instincts rooted in love also include a built-in tension. The \u201csocial suite\u201d includes a profound preference for family, friends, and wider \u201cin-groups,\u201d which leads to an \u201cotherization\u201d of those not part of the group.\nYet this \u201cin-group bias\u201d is essential for the larger \u201cgood\u201d society the social suite builds. \u201c[Cooperation] is supported not only by the fact that we reliably interact with friends rather than strangers within the face-to-face networks we fashion,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut also by the fact that we form groups whose boundaries we enforce by coming to like those within the group more than those outside of it.\u201d\n\u201cPeople everywhere choose their friends and prefer their own groups,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn turn, cooperation is a crucial predicate for social learning, one of our species\u2019 most powerful inventions.\u201d\nIn the early chapters of \u201cBlueprint,\u201d Dr. Christakis examines the social organization of a number of \u201cunintentional communities,\u201d like the survivors of shipwrecks. In some, cliques began to compete and the society disintegrated; in others cooperative instincts prevailed.\nIn others, he describes the formation of intentional communities, including religious groups like the Shakers, or artificial communities, like online gamers. And while aspects of the \u201csocial suite\u201d are always at work, the kinds of societies that can emerge are not always \u201cgood,\u201d per se.\n\u201cPeople often think that personality traits such as kindness are fixed,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut our research with groups suggests something quite different: the tendency to be altruistic or exploitative may depend heavily on how the social world is organized.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an irony at the heart of the \u201coptimistic\u201d theodicies, too. Theologians have often argued that there can be no virtue without the reality of vice, no beauty without the facts of chaos, and that no true character can be formed in a life without tests.\nAll societies, from individual family units to civilizations, are shaped by a swirl of often ambivalent human instincts. But in many ways, \u201cBlueprint\u201d argues, the most enduring societies are those most rooted in love.\n\u201cLove is a particularly distinctive human experience,\u201d he writes. \u201cLove also paves the way, evolutionarily speaking, for us to feel a special connection not only to our kin, but also, ultimately, to unrelated individuals.... We form long-term, nonreproductive unions with other humans. This is exceedingly rare in the animal kingdom, but it is universal in us.\u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

{"article": "Over time VR might emerge as a viable consumer platform, but making it a success, and even a revolution, will depend on finding a way to make content specifically tailored to help Facebook sell more advertising dollars.\nThis is a truism for any new digital medium, but with VR it\u2019s perhaps even more true given the fact that Facebook is sitting in a position of real control, with 2 billion users worldwide and more than 1 billion monthly active users of the social network within its own apps.\nThis story first appeared in the April 15, 2015 issue of WWD. Subscribe Today.\nThat\u2019s what convinced Dave Singh, VP of publishing at Oculus VR, that his company\u2019s cross-buy strategy would be a perfect fit for the potential success of virtual reality. You see, Facebook is the richest digital media platform around today, and only through optimizing how it approaches selling ads on platforms beyond Facebook\u2019s own platform will it be able to drive up sales on apps, games and other VR products.\n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in marketing and monetization of our own content and our developer\u2019s content on a 360 degree world. Facebook, in terms of a primary user platform, they\u2019re a fantastic fit,\u201d Singh told WWD in an interview following a keynote speech at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain last month.\nYou might be wondering why the Oculus team has focused on Facebook and its unique position on a platform that aims to bring millions of consumers into the future. Turns out the strategy was partly an attempt to take a sledgehammer to the competitors that are claiming they can be a serious threat to Facebook, particularly on the mobile front.\n\u201cThe Facebook platform provides us a great platform for distribution and also gives us an ability to drive large installs across the thousands of developers who are supporting Rift,\u201d Singh said. \u201cNot only do we bring new installs to Rift but we deliver our developers the ability to set up a user base on Facebook on mobile and then transition them over to Rift.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t something Oculus had to bring up at MWC, in fact the company was a notable presence at the conference, both on the show floor and in the technology center on the ground floor. Oculus didn\u2019t show off the Oculus Playground program \u2014 a collection of fun VR apps and games \u2014 since it doesn\u2019t offer content for mobile.\nBut this marks Oculus\u2019 first major foray into VR software distribution outside of its own platform, with Facebook as a primary avenue of entry.\n\u201cCertainly on the advertising side, we\u2019re not focusing as much on that, but what we\u2019re doing with Oculus Playground and things like that is leading the charge in terms of figuring out how to create great experiences and then using that as an entry point to get people to see Facebook.\u201d\nWhile everyone should expect VR to do the same things for Facebook that any other platform has for years \u2014 teach people to click on ads, drive up sales \u2014 it\u2019s going to be especially important to find a way to maximize sales on Facebook for VR apps and content.\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that VR could become a major force in other areas besides content sales. When we spoke to Singh about the social service\u2019s purpose in VR last September, he pointed out that because the experience is so immersive, it could do things like lead to augmented reality interaction and increase engagement at the same time.\nThe way it is currently defined, Facebook fits right in. \u201cI don\u2019t think VR has an overlap with Facebook\u2019s main product,\u201d Singh said. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely new form of interaction. I think that it represents some of the benefits that AR would have\u2026 though the potential is unlimited.\u201d\n(Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited the term cross-buy as a sort of workaround to making cross-title sales happen.)\n", "domain": "venturebeat.com", "title": "Oculus VR\u2019s cross-buy strategy main goal: Facebook platform lock-in", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Ian Hamilton", "ind30k": 8958, "url": "https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/14/oculus-vrs-cross-buy-strategy-main-goal-facebook-platform-lock-in/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Today, according to a series of reports prepared by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, and released on Wednesday, China invests around $12 billion a year in fewer than a dozen countries.\nThe investments are usually in sectors from oil and gas to telecommunication and financial services. They include investments into the highest-tech sectors, such as space launch, shipbuilding, and electric cars. At least half the companies China invests in are under state control.\nIn a warming of relations, China decided in January to invest $7 billion in a new railway through Africa, and it\u2019s looking to triple the size of its African bank, which received a Chinese bailout last year and was among the largest lenders in the 2015 oil rout.\n\u201cAs trade tensions with the US escalate, China is clearly competing on the stage and the economic space that the US and its friends occupy,\" says Robert Blake, chairman of the CSIS International Economic Affairs Board and former US trade representative.\nChina is not trying to stifle US businesses or America\u2019s leadership in some fields, such as artificial intelligence or robotics. Nor are the Chinese working to steal the intellectual property of American companies. But the trend is an unmistakable sign of Chinese ambitions to consolidate its stature in the global economy.\nIn the past, Chinese firms tried to emulate American technology or establish businesses as close to US soil as possible. That approach met resistance from Washington and US allies. But that appears to be changing.\nIn January, China pledged to invest $12 billion in a high-speed rail line across Africa. A week later, it announced $7 billion for a second railway, while matching the initial train. China is in advanced negotiations with Angola for a $25 billion African power plant and $5 billion in oil pipelines.\nCountries facing growing Chinese investment may not view it as a balance against America\u2019s strength and economic interests. But officials may not fully understand the many benefits of Chinese investments, ranging from better infrastructure to growing foreign reserves.\nThe overall trend is not good for the US. The US remains the world\u2019s biggest economy, with $19.8 trillion in gross domestic product.\nChina, which doesn\u2019t publish statistics on its GDP, was the world\u2019s third-largest economy, with $11.3 trillion in 2015.\nIndia now has the fourth-largest economy, after China, the US, and Japan. While neither the US nor India is China in terms of wealth, both are now similar in size to China and are making increasing inroads in the developing world. China could become the world\u2019s second-largest economy by 2050, analysts say.\n\u201cChina now is a major geopolitical player, whether you care about its prowess in Asia or its advancing global influence,\" Blake says. \u201cIt\u2019s doing more than ever before in terms of establishing its global presence,\" says Blake. \u201cAll the other powers are in the same boat with China.\"\nThe question is whether Trump will push back on China to protect the interests of US companies. Withdrawing from TPP, and failing to lead efforts for more international trade enforcement, will diminish American influence, putting China back at the helm of the global order.\n", "domain": "livemint.com", "title": "The US is losing a major front to China in the new cold war", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 4082, "url": "https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/the-us-is-losing-a-major-front-to-china-in-the-new-cold-war-1555356809105.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "In the run-up to the 2018 midterms, the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s courage faced down a ferocious campaign led by Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser and confidant Steve Bannon\nThe WikiLeaks whistleblower Julian Assange had a dubious claim to fame that did not allow him to reach too far into the Hollywood mainstream. Then, in 2017, a complex and high-stakes plot by an organisation he founded resulted in him finding himself on the television screens of the average American \u2013 not as the progressive icon that the movie makers had envisioned, but as the enemy of Washington\u2019s foes.\nA documentary with the less flattering subtitle of Embedded with WikiLeaks explained the inner workings of the organisation, and the extraordinary sacrifice of the Australian who worked with Julian Paletta, the US-based host. But the final word came from Eric Stangel, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and noted Watergate sleuth, who urged viewers not to confuse Assange for his celebrity profile. \u201cDon\u2019t buy the fairytale. This is no fairy tale.\u201d\nBut it is no fairy tale, and the film \u2013 after a successful US roll-out \u2013 has now been released overseas.\nOn 15 August 2018, after the United States had already booted WikiLeaks off social media, and barred the group from its offices on Capitol Hill, it published the emails of leading Democrats in the US Congress, alongside 8,000 secret Clinton campaign emails. It was later confirmed that the leaked emails had come from the servers of the Democratic National Committee.\nAs with the Trump-Russia collusion scandal, there was no criminal prosecution, but the bitter partisan battles that followed quickly boiled over into political warfare that had on one side the Republicans whose fortunes had been ruined by Hillary Clinton; on the other, the Democrats\u2019 victors, who had gone into hyper-partisan splutter mode.\nAs the year proceeded, the disgruntled warring sides both continued to publicly accept the blue-chip standards that had been set by Trump\u2019s tax cut and other first-year policies, while infuriating each other.\nThe catastrophe left Trump, like George HW Bush the year before, in need of a not inconsiderable political capital, which Bannon believed he could capitalise on by drawing the Trump loyalists closer to the base. He would have none of the supposed academic approach to politics espoused by Trump\u2019s former rival Jeb Bush, including \u201canchor babies\u201d. He would dismiss all non-white people in a chilling monologue, and try to divide the ruling Republican party between its nativist-nationalist and the much bigger pro-immigration wing.\nWhile Bannon was hard at work on a remake of a great Republican campaign, the WikiLeaks release was going down very well with Democrats. While Trump duly swore to punish Assange and the people involved, it was clear that Clinton felt better armed because of Assange\u2019s actions. The former secretary of state had faced the urgent threat of the Electoral College, which had the power to throw the election to the Democrat, so anything that helped shorten that path was to be welcomed.\nBill Kristol, one of the most prominent onetime Trump critics in the party, wrote in a Sunday New York Times article that while WikiLeaks had in the past failed to reveal the candidacies of John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, the 2018 data was a case in point. \u201cWikiLeaks was not content to compromise the Clinton campaign. It sought to leave the impression that the DNC and Clinton campaign were on the ropes in the face of opposition from the Kremlin.\u201d\nWeeks later, that illusion was shattered in a meeting in London between Assange and the British intelligence agency MI6. His claim that the Trump campaign had been behind WikiLeaks in July 2016 would soon crumble. In a meeting that was never disclosed, MI6 agents told Assange and his representative, Sarah Harrison, that US intelligence had been feeding WikiLeaks it own fake data, which it subsequently used in the release of the leaked emails.\nIf Trump had believed it, and had not already pooh-poohed the significance of the information in the WikiLeaks publication, the revelation that the communications firm Cambridge Analytica was running the data-collection effort, which further harmed Clinton, may have in hindsight been a wake-up call.\nBy that point, Bannon had pulled the plug on his Breitbart website, and had accepted the painful reality that he had lost the Trump supporters that had propelled him to the presidency, and also faced enormous pressure from the investigations into Trump\u2019s Russian collusion. Bannon was also doing something that he had almost always done well: casting the story in a toxic, unheroic light. He was denouncing the FBI as \u201ca bunch of deeply inbred leftist swamp creatures\u201d, and Trump as an \u201cidiot\u201d.\nThe storyline of WikiLeaks as the fake news accomplice of the", "domain": "theguardian.com", "title": "Julian Assange: the wedge that created a divide among Trump loyalists", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": "Julian Borger", "ind30k": 759, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/11/julian-assange-extradition-russia-trump-presidency", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "The Turner Classic Movies Films biopic on actor Richard Chamberlain (center) will be backed by Seth Rogen and Brian Grazer's Open Road Films as TCM launches a series of acquisitions.\nIs Turner Classic Movies' For the Record: The Brat Pack the new MTV? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s been asked by some corners since the release of In Living Color in June 1992, but it\u2019s justifiable given the success of the TCM documentary that takes a warts-and-all look at the teens who influenced a generation: Cold Case Files.\n\"We have enough hits in our library already,\" TCM president Michael Angelo tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"The idea was to think about ways to introduce younger audiences to the movie star archetype, to help create that over-the-top, no-holds-barred documentary.\"\nHe's hired UCLA media studies professor Bill Doyle to develop the idea, with backing from top producers and directors, including Seth Rogen and Brian Grazer. The film, which will feature eight different directors and actors, has been in development since last fall.\nIn the seven months since, Angelo has signed a rights deal with filmmaker Seth Gordon (King of Kong), starring in-demand stars Maggie Grace (Lost) and Taylor Lautner (Twilight), and on-set interviews with icon Stephen Sondheim. \"We\u2019re taking our time. We've got the best documentary group in the country,\" says Angelo, who is planning to make forays into festival territory with films based on stars like Bette Davis and Dean Martin. The prospect of a TV format inspired a last-minute last-minute development for the film: TCM president Gena McCarthy mentioned in a dinner talk to the Film Society of Lincoln Center's board of trustees in February that they were in the process of shooting a sneak peak, which will premiere April 12 on the TCM website.\nAs he builds the archive, Angelo will continue his push to increase TCM's profile as a box-office destination, striking a first-look deal with Open Road Films to ensure that the occasional film made for television will see the light of day on his channels.\n\"There\u2019s one disadvantage that gets people thinking that we're little old ladies,\" Angelo says of TCM's aging demo, \"and that's the awards season. There aren't all these great movies that go out under that big A-list umbrella.\"\nStill, Angelo\u2019s most coveted title, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Django Unchained, is due to reach TV for the first time in May, and for a time he planned to drop the DVD onto the street instead of in Best Buy retail stores, at which point he'd sell it for a loss.

You can\u2019t get any answers.\u201d\nIn its inspection, the CQC said CNet\u2019s priorities for improvement were safety, infection control, ill-treatment and neglect, quality of care and improvement.\nBut Dorothy said: \u201cNo one I spoke to on the day of the inspection was open about anything and staff kept trying to talk us out of having a meeting.\u201d\nSome concerns highlighted by the CQC at the report\u2019s conclusion were resolved, but the charity\u2019s \u201curgent and major\u201d recommendations remain \u201cworthwhile\u201d and \"far from resolved\".\n\u201cThe trust will need to undertake further significant work in order to improve the quality of care that the patients receiving care at Longfleet House can expect,\u201d the report said.\nNHS Direct did not suggest that the hospital was being visited to inspect their own operations, but they will continue to work with NHS Direct to give NHS managers a \u201crobust, up-to-date picture\u201d of how CNet\u2019s members of staff perform in their role.\nDorothy said she was proud of the progress CNet has made in six months, but is not satisfied with the survey's findings.\n\u201cThe result is a snapshot in time. We\u2019re looking at the other side of the building and the residents are doing well.

{"article": "While the national debt of the United States was recorded at 22.03 trillion as of April 2019, Washington\u2019s going ahead with its hawkish policies worldwide with recent NATO summit pushing for further unity against China, Russia and Iran. NATO\u2019s annual overall military budget was US$ 957 billion in 2017 where the US\u2019s share was US$ 686 billion, accounting for 72 percent of the total. This number is pressed by the US to rise in the years to come.\nAccording to The Guardian, Trump takes more than $1tn in taxpayer money and allocates $750bn to the military. In other words, out of every taxpayer dollar, 62 cents go to the military and Department of Homeland Security and seven cents to Veterans affairs. It leaves just 31 cents for all the rest: education, job training, community economic development, housing, safe drinking water and clear air, health and science research and the prevention of war through diplomacy and humanitarian aid.\nThe Trump budget finds vast billions for militarization, while it cuts \u201csmaller\u201d poverty alleviation projects and other programs, claiming the goal is to save money.\nRutherford Institute\u2019s founder and director John W. WhiteHead writes in his institute\u2019s website that the American nation is being preyed upon by a military industrial complex that is propped up by war profiteers, corrupt politicians and foreign governments. He remarks:\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that your hard-earned tax dollars are being used for national security and urgent military needs\u201d.\nHe writes \u201cyou know what happens to tax dollars that are left over at the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year? Government agencies \u2013 including the Department of Defense \u2013 go on a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 spending spree so they can justify asking for money in the next fiscal year\u201d.\n\u201cWe are talking about $97 billion worth of wasteful spending\u201d\nHe maintains that the nation\u2019s educational system is pathetic, the infrastructure is antiquated and growing more outdated by the day and the health system is overpriced and inaccessible to those who need it most.\nThe tax cuts on super-rich, outflow of huge sums in interest payment for debt and more spending are plunging the US economy into a new crisis, according to many authors. The US economy faces a deficit which means the spending especially on military and defence is far exceeding the tax revenues.\nIn 2017, US spent US$ 685,957 billion with 3.6 of its GDP on military spending while the UK stood second at US$ 55,237 billion with 2.1 per cent of GDP. France and Germany allocated US$ 45,927 billion and 45,472 billion respectively with 1.8 and 1.2 percent of their GDPs. The NATO member states are pressured for raising their defense spending to 2 percent and gradually up to 4 percent in five years.\nAccording to a study regarding world powers\u2019 overseas military bases\nChina retains twelve military bases;\nFrance runs nine military bases including in Germany, Lebanon and UAE;\nGermany has two military bases in France and United States;\nIndia has seven bases including in Tajikistan and Maldives;\nIsrael possesses one military base in Syria\u2019s Golan Heights;\nPakistan has a military center with 1,180 personnel in Saudi Arabia;\nRussia runs eight military facilities including in Armenia, Georgia, Syria and some Central Asian countries;\nUK controls ten military bases including in Bahrain, Canada, Germany, Singapore and Qatar;\nthe US is leading nearly 800 military bases across the world that run in full swing with the highest budget.\nIn other words, the US possesses up to 95 per cent of the world\u2019s military bases. The Department of Defense says that its locations include 164 countries. Put another way, it has a military presence of some sort in approximately 84 percent of the nations on this planet.\nThe annual cost of deploying US military personnel overseas, as well as maintaining and running those foreign bases, tops out at an estimated US$ 150 billion annually. The US bases abroad cost upwards of US$ 50 billion only for building and maintenance, which is enough to address pressing needs at home in education, health care, housing and infrastructure.\nIn 2017 and 2018, the world\u2019s largest military spenders were the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and India. The UK took over France as sixth largest spender in 2018 while Japan and Germany stood at eighth and ninth positions.\nIn early 2018, Pentagon released a report saying that Afghan war costs US$ 45 billion to taxpayers in the preceding year. Of this amount, US$ 5 billion has been spent on Afghan forces, US$ 13 billion towards US forces in Afghanistan and the rest on economic aid.\nBut these costs are far lower than the time when the US military was highly engaged in Afghanistan. With nearly 100,000 soldiers in the country from 2010 to 2012, the price for American taxpayers surpassed US$ 100 billion each year. For now, there are around 16,000 US troops in Afghanistan. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars have gone into Afghanistan, the US admits it failed in war against militants in Afghanistan.\nIn November 2018, another study published by CNBC reported that America has spent US$ 5.9 trillion on wars in the Middle East and Asia since 2001 including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The study also reveals that more than 500,000 people have been killed in the wars and nearly 10 million people have been displaced due to violence.\nThe US has reportedly spent US$ 1.07 trillion in Afghanistan since 2001 which include Overseas Contingency Operations funds dedicated to Afghanistan, costs on the base budget of the Department of Defense and increase to the budget of the Department of Veteran Affairs.\nIn Afghanistan, the US costs of war in 2001 commenced with US$ 37.3 billion that soared to US$ 57.3 billion in 2007 and US$ 100 billion in 2009. The year with record spending was 2010 with US$ 112.7 billion that slightly plummeted to US$ 110.4 billion in 2011 but took downwards trend in the later years.\nDue to skyrocketing military costs on the US government, Trump Administration recently decided to pack up some of its military bases in Afghanistan and Middle East to diminish expenditures, though it doesn\u2019t mean the wars would end at all.\nAccording to Afghanistan Analysts Network, the US Congress has appropriated more than US$ 126 billion in aid for Afghanistan since financial year 2002, with almost 63 percent for security and 28 percent for development and the remainder for civilian operations, mostly budgetary assistance and humanitarian aid. Alongside the US aid, many world countries have pumped millions of dollars in development aids, but what is evident for insiders and outsiders is that a trickle of those funds has actually gone into Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction.\nWith eighteen years into Afghan war, the security is deteriorating; Afghan air force is ill-equipped; poppy cultivation is on the rise; roads and highways are dilapidated or unconstructed; no mediocre hospital and health care has been established; weekly conflict causalities hit 150-250; electricity is still imported from Central Asian countries; economy remains dependent upon imports; unemployment rate is at its peak; more than three quarters of population live under poverty line and many, many more miseries persist or aggravate.\nThe US boasts of being the largest multi-billion dollar donor for Afghanistan, but if one takes a deeper look at the living standards of majority and the overall conditions, it can be immediately grasped that less than half of that exaggerated fund has been consumed. The US-made government of Afghanistan has deliberately been left behind to rank as the first corrupt country in the world. Thanks to the same unaddressed pervasive corruption, a hefty amount of that fund has been either directed back to the US hands or embezzled by senior Afghan officials.\nAfghanistan\u2019s new Living Conditions Survey shows that poverty is more widespread today than it was immediately after the fall of Taliban regime, or in other words, in the early days of US invasion.\nNext month, Kabul will host a Consultative Loya Jirga attended by around 2,000 representatives from Afghanistan which will cost the Afghan Ministry of Finance AF 369 million (equivalent to five million US$). Even as the past has proved that these events are only symbolic and further complicating the achievement of peace, a country with great majority under poverty line doesn\u2019t deserve to organize such costly gatherings.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

{"article": "PORTLAND, Ore. (CN) \u2013 Three girls have been shuffled in and out of foster care over the last four years at the hands of a state employee with \u201ca bizarre and obsessive pattern of sending the girls nude photos,\u201d coercing sex acts, and bullying other girls, the trio claim in Federal Court.\nShineglian Briscoe, Sarah Burns and Faith Ritter say that in 2016 the Oregon Department of Human Services, under the leadership of Executive Director Gene Levoff, \u201cfailed to investigate or discipline any of the convicted felons who were permitted to interact with foster children for prolonged periods of time.\u201d\nTwo of the girls \u2013 Shineglian and Sarah \u2013 were taken into the Oregon foster care system in 2012. Shineglian, now 18, claims her \u201cinappropriate sexual conduct\u201d with her foster father led to a felony assault charge. After a hung jury, Shineglian pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge. She was placed in another foster home until June 2013, when she moved to another \u201cnoncompliant\u201d foster home, according to the lawsuit.\nDuring Shineglian\u2019s incarceration, the Oregon foster home \u201cfurther raped Shineglian over and over again.\u201d\nSarah, now 14, was removed from her foster home in late 2014 after Sarah became \u201cthe butt of repeated jokes and verbal abuse from Sarah\u2019s foster parent.\u201d Sarah was placed in an \u201ceven worse, less-adequate\u201d foster home, but the abuse continued. Sarah\u2019s \u201cfoster parents repeatedly told Sarah that if she would only sleep with them, they would change her bad self to \u2018good,'\u201d the lawsuit states.\nOn one occasion Sarah\u2019s foster mother sexually assaulted her, the lawsuit says. Sarah says that this conduct increased the stress that she was suffering \u201cdue to her unstable, difficult home environment.\u201d\nSarah\u2019s foster parents also forbade her from wearing her makeup, and told her \u201cthat if she did, they would bring out the \u2018tramp stamp\u2019 on Sarah and tattoo it on her leg.\u201d\nOn another occasion Sarah\u2019s foster parents \u201cbrandished a pack of condoms that were shoved in Sarah\u2019s mouth at the dinner table and told Sarah that they were \u2018acting the part.\u2019 They also made Sarah clean her own urine out of her own pants,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nAt one point in 2015, Sarah says, her foster parents asked a friend to take pictures of her dressing. Sarah was \u201ctruly distraught\u201d and \u201cdepressed\u201d and asked to be pulled out of the photo shoot, the lawsuit states. But her foster parents told her \u201cshe was a bad child and kept her in the photo shoot until she was happy.\u201d\nAs Shineglian and Sarah\u2019s foster parents had done with her, Sarah\u2019s foster parents hung her pictures on a rack, \u201cculled them off each day,\u201d and \u201cchewed her hair\u201d to demonstrate that her hair was in disarray when she went outside.\nAt school, Sarah says, she received a photo of a cat and the words \u201cWomb Cat\u201d printed on the front of the picture.\nAt her therapist\u2019s insistence, Sarah\u2019s foster parents brought her to a \u201cvolunteer-oriented\u201d foster home on the North Plains City Council, \u201cwhere Shineglian was forced to perform sexual acts, which the foster parents either did not understand or did not want to tell the others about,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nWithin three months of being at the home, Shineglian was assaulted again, and told her mother, Sarah says. Shineglian also had a constant \u201cnaked picture\u201d of a cat made of white string in her home, which Shineglian\u2019s foster mom would pull out for other children, the lawsuit states.\nHer foster parents again failed to provide her with effective therapy, leaving Shineglian even more traumatized than she had been, the lawsuit states.\nSarah and Shineglian say the state care was bad enough that Shineglian fell through the cracks into the foster home where Sarah was placed.\nAccording to the court document, the average wait for a foster placement in Oregon is three to five years.\nShineglian\u2019s attorney Frank Starr told Courthouse News that at least three more siblings are expected to come forward with similar abuse allegations.\nHe said that on Monday the allegations prompted the Oregon Attorney General\u2019s Office to open a criminal investigation into the Department of Human Services.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "domain": "courthousenews.com", "title": "Lawsuit by Oregon Foster Kids Details Litany of Abuses by State", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": "Karina Brown", "ind30k": 4345, "url": "https://www.courthousenews.com/oregon-foster-kids-detail-litany-of-abuses-by-state/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Model Doutzen Kroes showed off her talents in a new photo shoot. The posting was part of Michael Graham\u2019s Instagram Live session, and included both walking around in small boots and moving in a stilt-like position. In the black-and-white photo, the Victoria\u2019s Secret model went totally topless, wearing a black bra and a loose-fitting denim shirt. The other photo showed her standing in a chair, which she turned toward the camera, also wearing a look and a dark hat. Doutzen\u2019s hair was done in loose waves, and she made sure to post a quote for those fans that wanted a little nudge.\nMeanwhile, it was still raining when her post-shoot session went down, and she shared a video that showed her walking around with a backpack, the front of which was completely down, as she took out the camera.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Doutzen has a regular gig as an ambassador for Adidas, as it\u2019s a big draw for athletes and even their children. For example, a video showed her interacting with two kids wearing Adidas caps and wearing shoes. The photo also showed her crouching down in the grass to receive messages. She\u2019s also a spokesperson for a number of European Olympic teams and the Israeli Athletics Federation.\nAs for her other recent projects, Doutzen worked on the original video for Love First: Feat. Fendi, which is a song by Ludacris. Her name appears in the lyrics as she addresses her husband, Sunnery James. She described the process, which included several different production options.\n\u201cYou know with music it\u2019s so different, and you\u2019re allowed to be whatever you want. You have to keep on rotating the visuals and keep your visuals fresh, and on top of that there\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s such a loud song, so when it\u2019s in the studio, they were like: \u2018Can you play this in pitch over?'\u201d\nAfter working on that song, Doutzen was spotted at a Met Gala afterparty at the Park Avenue Armory in NYC on Saturday night. The model dressed in a plunging red, long-sleeved dress. She posed next to singer Miguel on the red carpet, while Sunnery and DJ Samantha Ronson also attended. It was an intense affair, as Celebuzz detailed.\n\u201cWith a good-looking guy like Miguel, you\u2019d be expected to spill your coffee and smack your cheek. But the Ukraine-born model kept her coverup beneath her back chair. She had something that may have looked like a crop top, but was actually just a patterned cardigan.

{"article": "By Michael Holden\nLONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The consequences of Britain's looming Brexit will have long-term consequences for thousands of Europeans who live and work in Britain, including some 2,300 homeless people.\nAs Britain prepares to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, the rise of the far-right in Europe has fueled uncertainty, prompting many people to stay put, unsure of their long-term security.\nJust how many are homeless depends on which agency you ask, however. Last month, the homelessness charity Crisis reported a 60 percent rise in the number of people sleeping rough since 2015.\nThe British Council, an international organisation responsible for promoting British trade abroad, believes the problem is bigger than first believed.\n\"If the house price bubble continues, if an exit from the EU doesn't go through without a costly exit fee, where do people find a secure home to live in?\" said Fraser Steel, Britain's ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\"The number of asylum seekers will also increase, although that depends in part on the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\"\nThe charities Crisis and Shelter estimate there are up to 7,700 people on Britain's streets who are European Union citizens. But the government's rough sleeping strategy acknowledges that number could be as high as 9,500.\nExperts say the higher figure could include many who prefer to be outside rather than in a tent or sleeping bag and rather than sleeping rough are couch-surfing in their own home or taking refuge in friend's or family's homes.\nJuliet Blake, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"What we have to look at is those who are homeless because they have no more housing choices.\"\nMAINTENANCE, PRAYERS\nBritish homeless charities have borne the brunt of the problem. They have asked local councils to find places for the homeless and charge rent in advance if they cannot. Some supply beds, and send clothing and meals to the homeless, by bus, train or van.\nThe Facing Homeless initiative, backed by the European Commission, estimates that a Brexit-related decline in immigration and a consequent tightening of welfare for EU citizens could push almost 2,000 homeless people into crisis.\nA British government report last month estimates that up to 400,000 jobs in Britain are currently vacant and yet some companies say immigration has made it difficult to fill jobs.\nOfficials say Britain's economy will be resilient and will continue to function after Brexit despite warnings from the International Monetary Fund that there will be a recession.\nYet people living in Britain are taking nothing for granted. People are scrambling to find work on a variety of visas, in public housing or funding grants to supplement their income.\n\"For many refugees, including myself, we are in a revolving door: new job, one month on, one month off,\" said Janaina, a Syrian refugee in London.\nMany who are not entitled to work pay the penalty or risk losing their refugee status. A survey by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and London's Evening Standard newspaper found 15 percent of claimants were sanctioned for 13 weeks or more.\nThe government says most migrants come here legally, but immigrants from outside the EU are subject to different rules. For instance, they are not required to pay council tax in the first year of being in Britain.\nThey also need less time to lose their status and are not able to use family members to secure visas.\nWhen Ana, from the eastern Spanish city of Orihuela de Goytaz, set out to find a job in London last year, her application was swiftly turned down as she did not have the right documents.\n\"I went to get my papers and because I was in the country illegally, I was told that there was no way they would grant me a work permit,\" she said. \"I had to beg for money to feed myself.\"\nHer only option was to live on her savings and travel to London from Spain.\n\"I felt like a criminal. Someone brought me here to get rid of me. This is a circus, a joke,\" she said. \"I was all alone. You need that neighbour, that friend, that support group. You feel alone, depressed and frustrated.\"\nMar\u00eda Alejandra, a Spanish national who came to Britain to look for work, said she had her heart set on working but that was proving impossible.\nShe said Britain's time to leave the EU has helped to unify its often divided immigrants.\n\"In Spain, I lived in Germany and here we see this green line: here we are British. There we are Spanish,\" she said. \"That is the reason we are so happy to see Britain now.\" (Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n", "domain": "thisismoney.co.uk", "title": "Brexit threatens mayhem for homeless Europeans who call...", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 3382, "url": "https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6884255/Brexit-threatens-mayhem-homeless-Europeans-call-Britain-home.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) announced a $0.18 per share Special Periodic Dividend in December, 2015. This Dividend continued to be paid throughout 2016. In order to determine the sustainability of MAIN's dividend I've run two scenarios. First, I look at the cash flow component of the dividend. Second, I run a cash flow projection using a historical dividend rate, MAIN's historical operating performance, and the reserve as provided by MAIN in its 10-K. These two scenarios are presented below:\nCurrent Dividend Outstanding: $1.6 billion\nCurrent Cash Flow Maturity Balance and Closing Balance End Balance End 2016 December (plus Cash) $459.8 $649.2 $665.3 Operations ($227.3) ($200.3) ($229.0) Dividend ($20.8) $0 $1.6 Div yield 13.75% 7.36% 8.00% Q1/Q3 2015 operations ($226.8) ($200.3) ($229.0) Increase in cash (100.0) 100.0 (100.0) Less: Finance Charges $(23.3) $(23.1) $(23.1) Less: Depreciation ($28.7) ($29.8) ($30.5) Increase in cash (50.0) 50.0 (50.0) Less: Operating Expenses ($29.8) ($29.8) ($29.8) Increase in cash (100.0) 100.0 (100.0) Raised Dividend of $0.18 (160.0) ($1.3) Avg Payout Ratio 72.2% 30.7% 17.8%\nRegarded Solutions Dividend Model:\nIn addition to the current dividend (shown above), MAIN's cash flow position has been boosted by a $25 million loan to Delta Herc Equipment. This loan originally covered $25 million of inventory (with a 15% interest rate). MAIN is now set to receive cash of $31 million on the payoff of this loan.\nWhen taking these two assumptions into account, MAIN's 2016 dividend will remain at $1.60 per share. MAIN's dividend has a current yield of 15.7% as of April 12th, 2016. Should the stock price continue to move higher, a dividend of $1.63 (its current value as of April 12th, 2016) looks likely. MAIN would be paying a 66% payout ratio based on this number. This means that in order to sustain this level of dividend it would be necessary for MAIN to produce record earnings in 2017.\nAs we noted in my most recent article on MAIN, \"Main Street: Playing Offense With Missed Opportunities,\" MAIN's dividend has multiple moving parts which need to be considered. MAIN's Current Dividend is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in the debt market. MAIN's long-term debt obligations require periodic refinancing at the highest possible interest rate. MAIN may have to refinance its interest rate on the Delta Herc Loan in the coming months at higher rates.\nIf MAIN were to produce record earnings in 2017 (or 2018) this could increase MAIN's payout ratio by one percentage point or more. Because MAIN's capital gains currently make up a larger percentage of earnings, this deterioration in profitability could be offset somewhat by the increase in valuations of the portfolio.\nFrom a cash flow perspective MAIN's dividend is in good shape. However, as we have seen in the past two quarters the reliability of MAIN's dividend remains in question. MAIN's distribution of $1.6 per share in dividends suggests that the company expects a yield of 13.75% in the coming year. With dividends receiving another $0.18 special dividend in December, the overall yield would increase to a range of 14.3% to 14.7%. Although MAIN has grown its earnings in recent years (due to its lower expenses as a percentage of asset base) and is raising the dividend, it is possible that a change in the rates it can pay for loans will result in a dividend cut.\nMAIN's dividend looks safe for 2017. However, next year it may very well change. I suggest that income investors monitor MAIN's cash flow position.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MAIN.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

{"article": "A war rhino as seen in Marvel\u2019s Black Panther (Screenshot: Marvel Studios)\nSome 12,000 years ago, humans chose to domesticate much of the world that surrounds us. This intervention steered our evolution and the evolution of many plants and animals, transitioning our hunter-gatherer society into settled agriculture. Can we domesticate any animal? How does domestication work? And most importantly, can we domesticate rhinos as war mounts, as seen in the 2018 movie Black Panther?\nIn last year\u2019s acclaimed Marvel movie the Border Tribe of Wakanda serves as homeland security for protecting their country from interlopers and invading forces. In addition to being charged with disguising the nation\u2019s borders as a rural countryside, the tribe also manages part of Wakanda\u2019s military might with its blue-caped garrison and a cavalry of white rhino.\nIn Black Panther, white rhino are shown to be friendly enough to be hand fed by the tribe\u2019s head of security, W\u2019Kabi. They were also seen to be capable of recognising the social hierarchies established between humans, such as when W\u2019Kabi\u2019s vibranium clad rhino yielded to Wakandan Dora Milaje Okoye during the events of Black Panther.\nWhat exactly does it take to domesticate a wild animal? Is it as easy as running off into the savanna grasslands with a saddle? The best start is to look at how humans have domesticated animals in the last few thousand years\nThe advent of animal domestication happened during the agricultural revolution in approximately 10,000 BC in Central Asia and innovated the use of animals to cultivate land and serve the needs of humans. The use of a plough was driven by the domestication of animals capable of manual labour. Animals such as goats, sheep, and chicken that could also serve as a source of nutrition (milk and meat) or textiles (leather) were valued the most.\nThese could have been motivations to domesticate an animal like the White Rhino, but it doesn\u2019t seem like the animal would have been good for it. Rhino milk is not very rich in fats or protein, for example.Surprisingly, rhino may be good plough animals as demonstrated by a single white rhino in a safari park in Georgia (Thank you, YouTube).\nDomesticating rhinos would require a lot of work. The White Rhinoceros is the second largest mammal on land weighing in at more than 4,000 poundsand standing as tall as 1.83m and can run around 50 to 60 kilometres per hour.\nIn order for this Rhino to become domesticated we would have to assume that Wakanda and a pocket population of White Rhino shared a common ecosystem. Within this shared space, Wakandans would have to have spent hundreds of years taming individual Rhino. Taming rhino would involve behavioural conditioning to decrease the natural avoidance a rhino may have toward humans.\nThrough taming, members of Wakanda\u2019s tribes would identify docile individuals to selectively breed and generate a unique lineage of animals that, over generations, would become genetically different from their wild ancestors. These individuals would become the subjects of domestication and begin to be born with the behavioural traits that previously required taming. As seen with other domesticated animals, Wakandan White Rhinos would become more docile, and transition away from seasonal breeding into a more regular estrus cycle.\nFollowing changes to their behaviour, there would be additional desensitization to stress hormones, altered neurophysiology, and changes to brain development. This would result in reduced function of the limbic system and its control over aggression and its reaction to environmental stresses. In fact, we even have an idea which cells may underlie domestication syndrome.\nDuring the initial taming of Rhino, Wakandans would have to place themselves in an influential position in the complex social system of the rhino. This is thought to be one of the ways in which wolves could have been domesticated by humans to become dogs. Humans could assert dominance over these animals by deciding when they could eat and establish boundaries on their territories and behaviours.\nThankfully, the white rhino is already considered the most sociable species compared to black rhino and other Asian species, which are particularly aggressive and solitary.\nSome of the needed steps to domestication would be upsetting to people who love animals. One way to position a human into their social system would be to separate a mother from her recently born calves and have them imprint onto human caretakers, believing them to be their mother. This bond would allow some control over their confinement and when they could be released to graze.\nAs these calves reach adulthood, males are likelier to become aggressive and could be castrated to curb their aggression and testosterone. This is how stallions are made into geldings in order to accommodate their behaviours in stables. Gelding (or castration), I would assume would be among the duties of Wakanda\u2019s standing Black Panther since I don\u2019t think many other people could survive getting between a mother and its calf or a bull and its testicles.\nWakanda\u2019s Black Panther castrating rhinos isn\u2019t exactly canon, but it would make a lot of sense. Black Panther #1 (1988)\nSave for one talented White Rhino in Georgia, we have not been able to domesticate Rhinos as we have domesticated other animals for agriculture. As for using them for war, the idea of an armoured rhino being ridden into battle has an odd history. In 1515, a wood print of an Indian rhino was introduced to Europeans by the painter and printmaker, Albrecht D\u00fcrer. This depiction became incredibly popular and was made into a woodcut that replicated this picture for three centuries.\nThere was one problem. D\u00fcrer had never seen a rhino in his life and based the woodcut print off of a written description of what a rhino looked like and a sketch from an unknown artist. As you would imagine, this let D\u00fcrer\u2019s imagination add features that simply do not exist on the anatomy of a rhino. D\u00fcrer\u2019s rhino had riveted armour plates all over its body an extra horn on its back what looked like a breastplate.\nThis misrepresentation may have misinformed the perception of these creatures to Europeans, possibly leading them to believe that these animals can be used for war or serve as mounts.\nWoodprint of D\u00fcrer\u2019s Rhino (1515)\nAside from the skewed perceptions of Europeans 500 years ago, there are likely to be several other variables that would make domesticating rhinos difficult and possibly dangerous. For starters, their reproductive cycle is very long. Rhino females are capable of getting pregnant every 2-5 years for 16-18 months at a time and giving birth to only one calf. This calf then has to wait for 6 years before it becomes a reasonable size.\nCompare this to a heifer that takes 1-2 years to sexual maturity and its 9 months of pregnancy (and gives you milk and meat!). This is a very large commitment for very few gains. As for using them as mounts, they startle easily and have a sharp horn that would present a hazard for anyone who thinks they can saddle up. Worst of all most rhino have incredibly terrible eyesight and are only able to distinguish objects less than 4.57m away.\nTo be fair though, they make up for it with an incredible sense of smell and hearing but this is an evolved trait that keeps them alert of their otherwise quiet surroundings. At best, on the battlefield depicted in Black Panther, a rhino may charge through an army, just run away from the danger.\nOne other problem: they might wreck the country. Rhino would need a very large amount of land to graze off of which would make it difficult to raise them in captivity or shepherd across a savannah. Rhinos are actually considered keystone species, meaning their role is important enough to shape the ecology of their ecosystem.\nIn a normal environment, a rhino\u2019s grazing diversifies plant life, culturing a land that can support various other animals. In order to domesticate the animals and increase their numbers on the savannah, they would wreak ecological havoc on Wakanda\u2019s lands. Overgrazing by rhinos would destroy plant life over many acres, leading to erosion and desertification.\nThen again, the Wakandans are really smart. They might have solutions for all these problems. Perhaps a vibranium-based technology afforded Wakandans a means to wrangle their rhino humanely and safely?

Rather, the onboard space droid is the newly deployed Astrobee robot, a unmanned vehicle capable of self-testing robotic design and control technologies for NASA and private industry.\n\u201cIf we wanted to put a human on the International Space Station for many years to come, we would need new experiments,\u201d Paul Reller, director of NASA\u2019s National Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NJDL), said during a speech earlier this year. \u201cThere are only a few ways to do it today, but sooner or later, we need an entirely new generation of experiments.

However, this iteration will be especially useful for anyone working on their dream gadgets from the outside of the craft. Astronauts will help steer the Astrobee into a tight environment. Instead of using either a cable and foot restraints to grab onto an instrument or fixture, the Astrobee is controlled from the inside of the craft. If it\u2019s flying in close quarters, the robot will fly at what would be considered a \u201cpedestrian\u201d angle. However, when it\u2019s at a distance, Astrobee will attempt to replicate the force of gravity and coast like a flying saucer, treading water for a moment and then flying away.\nThe robot\u2019s learning curve is based on how it performs when navigating into tight spaces and gets into trouble. So far, it has crashed several times and the initial testing mission is currently in danger of going through glitches.

{"article": "After every disaster, when a reporter asks the survivors about their experiences, some with the utmost honesty and astonishment answer: \u201cWe never thought it would happen to us.\u201d\nAmericans are shocked to see that immigrant families, asylum seekers, babies being caged under a bridge in El Paso, Texas, in cold weather. Is this acceptable in the United States of America? The unfortunate reality is that the inhumane treatment (even temporarily) of the asylum seekers, (especially the children) has become a routine practice at detention centers for several years now.\nHowever, most were conducted behind closed doors and out of plain site. Even after the anguishing stories of tortured teenagers in custody (such as sexual abuse, beating, long periods of confinement and in some instances keeping the children nude in a cold concrete cell) which were exposed by the people who either used to work in these centers or by the Human Right Activists and Progressive Attorneys who were in contact with these teens; the politicians \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 and their media only spent a few short days or hours talking about these abuses. By diverting the public attention to the other issues, the abused teens were generally left in the detention centers as they were found. However, today the bold and naked abuse against migrants\u2019 families and caging them under a barbed wired bridge is done purposely in the public view to intimidate not just the immigrants but all dissent and democratic minded people.\nCaging innocent people in cold weather with crying babies under a bridge in the richest country on earth simply is not a bad decision but a clear message to all working families by some fascist elements in the U.S. government. This fact is understandable when we look at the bigger picture. The forces in the U.S. who are advocating and implementing their fascistic ideology, know the solidarity between the immigrants and American working families are indissoluble. They know that soon or later with the economic downturn, all poor people (regardless of their backgrounds and social statues) will find themselves on the same side against the wealthy elites. The feud among the 1% that is played on the media every day is actually about what is the best way to control and pacify the working people.\nThey are afraid of a united and organized people. The fascistic minded President and his gang in the Congress, Judicial System, Law Enforcement and Military are propagating the POLICY OF FEAR here and abroad! Democrats are fearful of these policies that might backlash and undermine the whole system. That is why Mr. Trump calls the Democrats \u201cweak\u201d.\nUnder both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump administrations, the immigrant children were detained in cages. No one can deny this fact any longer. However, Mr. Trump is proud of his \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d policy against immigrants or anybody else for that matter. He wants the world to see how the migrants\u2019 families are suffering under a bridge in the cold nights. This is the essence of the FEAR DOCTRINE. At the same time that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) were placing asylum seekers families beneath the Paso del Norte International Bridge in El Paso, Texas; Mr. Trump in Michigan at a rally as part of his usual fear mongering speech against the immigrants said: \u201cHundreds of thousands of people \u2026 are invading \u2026 our country \u2026. last month alone, more than 76 thousand illegal immigrants arrived at our borders \u2026 many of which are rough people \u2026 we have people that have criminal records \u2026 we apprehend them, we capture them \u2026 I.C.E., these are great American patriots. [cheers and applause]\u201d. Of course, as always, he wrapped his fascistic talk in the American flag.\nWealthy people, including the current U.S. President should be the last people to complain about the invaders! It was the greed of the American Capitalists and plundering of the natural resources and wealth of the countries in the Latin America for centuries which caused the inevitable break-down of all arbitrary national boundaries.\nThat is the root of migration. The working people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are seeking asylum in order to work and raise their families in peace. In fact in the 21st century, we have to recognize that they are the pioneers of our time, certainly not the invaders. The working people wherever they are or are forced to migrate; first and foremost they produce goods and contribute to their communities. On the other hand, \u201cleaders\u201d like Prime Minster May of UK / Netanyahu of Israel, President Macron of France /Poroshenko of Ukraine / Bouteflika of Algeria and of course Mr. Trump of the U.S. look like incompetent and useless politicians. They have nothing to offer except chaos, a group of people that look ridiculous in the world of politics.\nThe only miscalculation that the fascistic minded President Trump is not able to see is that the Fear Doctrine is effective only for a short time while the very people who are supposed to be fearful are rising up and are awakened by the 2016 election. That means the working families in the U.S. have the opportunity to get organized and unit for peace and prosperity for all by reaching to the history of the struggle of those who came before us, fought with their bodies and minds and left us with the most valuable heritage of unity and helpful guidelines.\nEnd the Cruelty and Inhumane Treatment of Immigrants Families NOW!\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

{"article": "A bankruptcy judge has rejected the motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the Lloyd's of London syndicates. The judge also said that defendants who had put up $15 million to help finance his 2005 acquisition of Miramax Films also didn't have an interest in insuring or indemnifying Weinstein.\nWeinstein has plenty of hopes from the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, and in a tentative opinion handed down on Friday, he says he could have settled this fight.\nThe legal dispute arises from the 2017 bankruptcy filing of his former company, The Weinstein Co., in which numerous employees have been able to tap multi-million dollar settlements to resolve sexual harassment and assault claims. Weinstein has a relatively large claim for himself and his businesses. On Friday, Judge Mary Walrath made public a set of papers filed on his behalf by Weinstein's lawyers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.\nOne document is titled \"Litigation Chips.\" In it, Weinstein says that two of the insurers \u2014 Chartis and Chubb \u2014 have a \"common, if not an identical, relationship,\" and that the companies have shared in claims and \"have behaved as a syndicate.\"\nAt the same time, the plans of each of the insurers to participate in this transaction \u2014 the amount they contribute is just a part of the argument \u2014 would pose a conflict and that a trustee should act in the best interests of creditors.\nWeinstein wants the judge to let the parties come to a decision on the details.\nBut this case is also dealing with an interest dispute. The insurers are seeking to establish a \"duty of good faith and fair dealing\" to respond to claims with claims that they have not paid. The insurance companies will argue that they have vested a right in that continuity.\nA default has been declared on the liabilities that are currently the subject of this dispute. The bankruptcy examiner recommends that liability be paid by one of the insurers to the bankrupt Miramax entities. Weinstein wants to participate in the monitoring and monitoring fee, and he wants all claims to be treated as an unsecured claim on the debtor's balance sheet, protected by the debtor's Chapter 11 creditors committee.\nMeanwhile, the claims against Weinstein and his entities have been put into his name. He filed a motion to dismiss the insurer lawsuits in October, stating: \"Solicitor General [Jill] Otworth has advised the Trustee that The Weinstein Company and Miramax do not owe any obligations to any insurers, but have asked the Trustee to disqualify Ms. Otworth from any hearings on Plaintiff\u2019s claims because of her efforts to free the Company and Miramax from the insurer\u2019s claims. If Plaintiff succeeds in obtaining relief from the Trustee, Ms. Otworth would, in our understanding, also seek a receiver on behalf of the Trustee and the Company, and would thus entirely destroy the Company and Miramax's most meaningful asset.\"\nThat motion to dismiss is under review. On the insurers' motion to dismiss last week, it was submitted that: \"The proposed motions could result in the Company and Weinstein failing to pay any of the claims against Weinstein and Weinstein Company for as long as thirty years.\"\nWalrath has now shot that down.\n\"The Companies' counter-motion ignores the distinct interests of the contrary parties,\" she writes. \"The Companies' motion focuses on Weinstein's claims and does not address the rights of the insurers or Plaintiff. Additionally, the motions are a matter of dispute, and the Companies do not anticipate the parties will resolve the dispute by negotiation.\"\nAll of which means that the latest hearing on this dispute on April 4 \u2014 one without the Weinstein name in it \u2014 won't involve the controversial payment by the Weinstein Co. to Mark Fabiani.\n", "domain": "hollywoodreporter.com", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Can't Stop Lawsuit From Insurers Who Don't Want to Defend Him", "date": "April 01, 2019", "authors": "Eriq Gardner", "ind30k": 6797, "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/harvey-weinstein-cant-stop-lawsuit-insurers-who-dont-want-defend-him-1198444", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

It\u2019s also something that researchers are just learning more about:\nThere are different kinds of black holes, like halos, filaments, and galaxies. The most common are elliptical black holes, which are narrow bands of space in which matter passes directly past each other and into a dense singularity.\nThere\u2019s also a very famous \u201cwormhole\u201d in our universe:\nThis is an imaginary space portal that exists within a particle physics study known as the LIGO interferometer, and has been subjected to numerous near-infrared simulations. It was hypothesized by Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and later confirmed by gravitational-wave observations with two LIGO interferometers located at Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana.\nRelated: How do you create a giant black hole in space?\nTo these researchers and others, black holes are the key players in almost everything, and they are filled with so much energy that nothing can escape their grasp.\nWe are often more excited by the details surrounding how black holes work than by their presence themselves.\nAnd 29-year-old photographer Meg Stephenson wanted to see what we could do with a massive black hole, which could only be seen in the cold vacuum of space, rather than in our live atmosphere.\nSteve Morgan, an assistant professor at Illinois Institute of Technology, \u201chad a research interest in astrophysics,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by space, and I had an eye on space, being an Indiana kid, and wanted to help out the sciences in some way.\u201d\nShe contacted a physicist friend, who told her that researchers were looking for a way to see into the very dark side of the universe.\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a contrast in the atmospheres of galaxies, and it\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the vastness. You don\u2019t see the physics. You just see these beautiful long corridors and valleys.

{"article": "Professor Amanda Lee, of the University of Queensland\u2019s School of Public Health, said it is \u201cexciting\u201d to finally have data for the burden of disease of poor diet as a \u201ctotal entity\u201d. Loading \u201cPoor diet is responsible for 22 per cent of deaths and 14 per cent of disability adjusted life years globally,\u201d Lee said. \u201cEverything we put into our mouth makes up our body... It\u2019s that old adage that you are what you eat. Of course diet is the major risk factor contributing to burden of disease globally and in Australia.\u201d There are multiple possible explanations for wholegrains, fruit and salt intake having a greater impact than eating enough vegetables, which only 7 per cent of Australian adults and 5 per cent of children manage. Variations of intake across countries may have skewed the results, or we may be seeing the effect of what we are eating in place of wholegrains and fruit, said public health nutritionist Dr Rosemary Stanton.\n\u201cFor example, when consumption of wholegrains is low, it is likely that the substitution made features refined grain products \u2013 as in sugary, low-fibre, highly processed cereal for breakfast rather than rolled oats, or hamburgers for lunch rather than cracked wheat salad or even a wholegrain salad sandwich,\u201d Dr Stanton explained. \u201cWith fruit, which is often consumed as a snack, the substitution may be confectionery or salty snacks.\u201d Dietitian Dr Joanna McMillan added that wholegrains and fruit also have health-protective nutrients in their own right. \u201cThe types of fibres wholegrains have we know to be particularly important for the microbiome and are more protective than fibres from other plant foods. That may, in part, simply be from quantity \u2013 you have to eat an awful lot of veggies to get the same levels of fibre as you get in a serve of a wholegrain,\u201d she explained. What we replace fruit or wholegrains with may have an effect as much as the benefits of eating them. Credit:Steven Siewert \u201cThere are also phytochemicals in the outer layers of the grain that are also beneficial, as well as key nutrients... Many think of fruit as a treat and not something that is wonderful for health. We have an abundance of evidence for the health benefits of both fruit and veggies, we need to encourage Australians to meet recommendations for both.\u201d\nIf the focus shifts to ensuring we eat enough of these healthy foods, does it matter if we eat junk foods too? \u201cWe know that, certainly in terms of mental health, even eating a little junk food alongside a healthy diet still has a negative impact. So both eating healthful foods and cutting the junk are key for best health,\u201d Dr McMillan said. \u201cIts likely that eating mostly a healthy plant-rich diet will mitigate some of the ill effects from eating too much junk... but it\u2019s impossible to say exactly how much junk is OK.\u201d Dr Stanton said there are rough rules about quantity. \u201cIf you eat chocolate daily, is it 30g or 300g? If you're also eating enough of the nutritional 'goodies', 30g would not be a problem, but 300g/day would be, with very few exceptions,\u201d she said, adding that if we eat more of one type of food we are less likely to eat a lot of another. \u201cFruit is one of the foods where substitution is relevant. Fruit is filling and telling people to eat this (say, an apple or banana) instead of that (say salty crisps or a Mars type bar) would be nice positive advice.\u201d\nProfessor Lee said for any recommendations to be effective, they need to be supported within the framework of a national nutrition policy. Loading \u201cWe have a nutrition policy vacuum in Australia at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cOur last nutrition policy was released in 1992. In 2013 I won the tender to scope the new nutrition policy in Australia. That\u2019s been buried... it\u2019s all there ready to go.\u201d Professor Lee blamed the food industry for the delay. As much as 35 per cent of the average Australian's energy intake (and 58 per cent of our food dollar) is spent on junk food and drinks. \u201cThe best buy globally of anything we can do for our health is to improve our diets, but it\u2019s going to take political will and it\u2019s going to take public will.\u201d\n", "domain": "smh.com.au", "title": "Eating these foods affects health more than avoiding junk food", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "Sarah Berry", "ind30k": 20738, "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/eating-these-foods-affects-health-more-than-avoiding-junk-food-20190409-p51cc5.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.0888145982741138}

One of those most affected by nuclear technology, in recent years, is the town of Chalk River, Ont.\nChalk River was home to Canada\u2019s first and most modern commercial nuclear reactors. The core reactor at Chalk River was the world\u2019s largest. The Heavy Water Reactor (HWR) was the world\u2019s most advanced.\nOther Canadian facilities, at the British Columbia Medical Research Institute in Burnaby and the National Research Council in Sudbury, all are important facilities in the discovery and development of nuclear technology.\nThese facilities save Canadians\u2019 lives. They save lives in hospitals and medical facilities across Canada and across the world. And all of those lives come from generating medical isotopes (MOX) in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada.\nMOX is a radioactive liquid that is used to create technetium. Technetium is a component of various medical isotopes, such as technetium 99 (which is used in our CT scans and ultrasounds), technetium 90 (used in our positron emission tomography scans), technetium 99m (used in our therapeutic imaging treatments) and technetium 92f (used in our pulse oximetry imaging tests).\nThousands of Canadians rely on OMNICare Medical Radioisotopes for medical care every year. OMNICare is a not-for-profit, patient-driven organization dedicated to ensuring that patients have access to the highest quality medical imaging services in Ontario and across Canada.\nIt takes more than just the making of these medical isotopes to save lives. It takes special facilities and critical equipment that are owned and operated by scientists from across the country, working together with thousands of technicians and technicians from across Canada.\nThe entire MMRC MOX program runs 24/7. There are nearly 3,500 full-time employees at the MMRC MOX program. The key ingredients are international expertise and partnerships that are essential to Canada\u2019s global position as a technology provider.\nThat is what the MMRC program does. That is what MUHC Technetium Molybdenum-99 (technetium 99) is doing. MUHC produces technetium 99 to support our aging and extremely complex facilities.\nOver the past two decades, MMRC MOX has created more than 1,300 technetium-99m devices, used by labs across the country.\nToday, about 790 of these machines are used to make medical isotopes. SMT and imaging radiology have a direct impact on more than a million patients.\nIn March, I visited the MUHC facility to witness first-hand the life-saving capabilities of this nuclear technology and to thank the thousands of Canadians who are personally benefiting.\nTogether with the MMRC program and other public agencies, we have for years invested tens of millions of dollars into equipment, training and infrastructure that supports OMNICare\u2019s growing programs. And today, we have a facility at the MUHC that has the capability to make one-quarter of all the world\u2019s technetium-99m machines.\nOur specialized Canadian workforce at MUHC Technetium Molybdenum-99 (technetium 99m) was responsible for producing 694 technetium-99m machines in 2018 alone.\nAll of these technetium machines, and millions of medical consultations across Canada, are prevented from happening without the amazing work the MMRC MOX program does.

In this case, it is the farmers\u2019 right, which is guaranteed in the constitution, to decide the ownership of the land,\u201d Antoniou said.\n\u201cWhile the tourists claim the right to wander on their land as long as they respect other people\u2019s right to walk on their own land, this also applies to the farmers,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the couple drove four jeeps and shared the drive by shooting their photos with cellphones.\nAntoniou explained that the farmers only found out after the fact and then asked police.\n\u201cThere are certain rules and regulations that apply to everyone when driving on the highways of Cyprus, but where do you draw the line between a car and a jeep,\u201d he asked.\nHe added that the law also says you can\u2019t touch the car\u2019s hood and, for example, break a window, but the couple went about it \u201cwithout showing any ill-intention and without breaking any laws\u201d.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they received the permission to be on the land or not,\u201d he said.\nThe lawyer said they also asked for the return of their Jeep as well as damages for trespass and damage to their vehicle.\nThe court said it had received a request for arbitration but gave no more details.\nThe couple are currently on a year-long visit to Cyprus.\n", "domain": "cyprus-mail.com", "title": "Fight between farmer and tourists over off-road vehicles", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Annette Chrysostomou", "ind30k": 9181, "url": "https://cyprus-mail.com/2019/04/15/fight-between-farmer-and-tourists-over-off-road-vehicles/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "By KEN THOMAS\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is taking new steps to limit lawsuits and payouts in lawsuits stemming from the manufacture of pelvic mesh devices, part of an effort to limit the effects of a product liability crisis that\u2019s resulted in substantial payouts to women who sued companies.\nThe FDA issued new guidance Tuesday on disclosing data used to determine how safe and effective pelvic mesh devices are. The agency also said that doctors who use the devices and companies that sell them may have to pay for many of the litigation costs.\nThe mesh devices are made of flexible mesh coated with rubber and implanted in the pelvic region to treat pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when the pelvic muscles and organs sag and give way. The potential hazards of the devices have long been known, but they have been more difficult to regulate than other medical devices because the pelvic tissue is often removed by doctors, and hospitals often do not have extensive computerized databases for monitoring them.\nLast year, the FDA approved a vaginal mesh device for treating incontinence, and has already announced a similar safety review for a type of stress urinary incontinence, which affects a much larger percentage of women.\nIn general, pelvic mesh devices have been associated with serious complications, including infections, prolonged incontinence and even death.\n\u201cThe new rules are a critical step in addressing the deeply disturbing health and legal issues facing women who have used pelvic mesh devices in surgeries,\u201d said Dr. William Cefalu, an obstetrician and gynecologist who currently serves as acting commissioner of the FDA.\n\u201cWe believe a large safety database is the best way to help prevent this disease \u2014 which has historically been undiagnosed, under-treated and misunderstood \u2014 from affecting women,\u201d Cefalu said.\nFDA officials were clear that doctors who use pelvic mesh devices must participate in a safety review to remain licensed to practice. They also said that if a hospital or health care institution has to pay to settle a lawsuit related to a mesh device that they must help fund. But Cefalu said the companies that make the devices would have to pay for most of the litigation costs.\nFDA advisers last year said the agency should compel manufacturers to take away their devices from doctors if they don\u2019t participate in the \u201csafety registry.\u201d But FDA officials said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to justify further restrictions, which would likely be challenged in court.\n\u201cWe believe that the use of safe and effective products remains a top priority,\u201d Cefalu said.\nThe impact of the new guidelines on clinics that offer pelvic mesh surgeries was unclear. The FDA also says the expanded use of the devices will continue because there is not enough data to determine that they have serious risks.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have often used the lack of data on the safety of pelvic mesh devices as the basis for their lawsuits.\nDr. Anthony Pelosi, director of North Carolina State University\u2019s Health Law Research Institute, said the agency\u2019s decision to require clinical data increases the likelihood that mesh will be marketed to menopausal women, many of whom need surgery to manage severe incontinence.\n\u201cHow many hospitals and surgeons will cut back on their procedures unless there is some burden on them to fill out a privacy sheet?\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cGiven that so many lawsuits are settling in a large part because of lack of clinical data, this adds to the bad faith, but this rule doesn\u2019t require you to say there is a problem and then come up with a solution.\u201d\n___\nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K.

This is a residential area.' And they immediately attacked me, 'Get back in your house, bitch, or we will kick your ass.'

{"article": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 How do you write about someone who has been talking sports in Cleveland for 50 years?\nName a Northeast Ohio radio station, and Les Levine probably has worked for it.\nName a communication medium, and he\u2019s been on it: Radio. Television. Cable television. Doing talk radio on television. Now, digital on Cleveland.com.\nHow do you write about someone who is now battling Parkinson\u2019s Disease\u2026\nAnd this came after his wife had breast cancer only two years ago\u2026\nAnd that was after his son became a single dad in 2012 when his 32-year-old wife died of cancer\u2026\nHow do you write about a man who ponders such deep questions as: \u201cHow come you drive on a parkway, but you park your car on a driveway?\u201d . . . Actually, that is one of his \u201cHow come quickies.\u201d\nMaybe you could try doing it in a \u201cVoice of Truth and Reason.\u201d But he\u2019s already done that. It\u2019s the name of his on-air commentaries.\nHow do you write about Levine, being honored for Excellence in Radio by the Cleveland Association of Broadcasters on April 11?\n\u201cYou start with the fact that he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d said Mike Bacon, a good friend and Executive Producer of his More Sports & Les Levine Show on Cleveland.com.\nHis brother, David Bacon, also is a producer of the show: \u201cJust a genuine good guy, that\u2019s who he is.\u201d\nHis wife Allison said strangers come up to Levine and talked to him as if they\u2019ve known for years.\n\u201cYou start with the name of his show -- More Sports and Les Levine,\u201d said his daughter, Jamie Levine Daniel. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate bad joke. He loves puns.\"\nJamie laughed.\n\u201cBut he\u2019s intelligent, he\u2019s funny, he\u2019s loyal and has a huge heart,\u201d she said.\nWELCOME TO RADIO\nOnce upon a time, Levine wanted to be a pro baseball player \u2014 and he played on some of Cleveland\u2019s top sandlot teams. Then he enrolled at Ohio State, where his baseball career lasted about three days.\nHis father wanted him to be a lawyer. He graduated with a degree in political science and was certified to teach elementary school. He stood in front of sixth grade classes for a bit in Lorain. But most of all, he loved the radio. Like many people who go into that business, they listen to it and think, \u201cHey, I can do that \u2013 just talk.\u201d\nHe went to broadcasting school. He saw an advertisement for a disc jockey in Jasper, Indiana. He\u2019d never heard of Jasper, Indiana, but he needed a job. He called the station manager, who asked him to send a tape of one of his broadcasts.\n\u201cI had no tape,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no real experience. I volunteered to drive down and interview.\u201d\nLevine left Cleveland, but made a side trip on the way to Jasper.\n\u201cI stopped at old Crosley Field in Cincinnati to watch part of the Reds game,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I drove all night, got into Jasper at 3 a.m. I found a grocery store parking lot with a few cars, pulled in and slept there.\u201d\nWhen he arrived for the 9 a.m. appointment at WITZ, he hadn\u2019t shaved or bathed. The station owner handed him some news to read. He did an audition in the studio, and was told he could start the following Monday. He spun the hits from 6 to 10 p.m., and also did the sports news. The year was 1970. The salary was $100 a week.\nCALL ME \u2018LES MOORE\u2019\nJasper is in South Central Indiana, about 65 miles from Evansville.\n\u201cThere were not a lot of Jews there,\u201d said Levine. \u201cSo I used the name \u2018Les Moore\u2019 on the air.\u201d\nIt was the first of his many puns. Levine said he was \u201cthe worst disc jockey ever.\u201d He also sold commercials for the station and did play-by-play for local high school basketball teams \u2013 \u201c10 bucks a game.\u201d\nHe had a Sunday morning job of making sure Reverend Johnny paid for his 7 a.m. radio show. He handed Levine an envelope, \u201cand I\u2019d put in the desk drawer. Never knew how much he paid.\u201d\nWhile Reverend was spreading the gospel on 99.1 AM, Levine was \u201cplaying beautiful music\u201d on 104.7 FM. He also read some funeral notices. Amazingly, none of this killed his career. Instead, it set up much of what Levine has done to survive in a brutal business for the last 50 years.\n\u201cSo many young people want to start in a major market,\u201d he said. \u201cGo somewhere and do everything.\u201d\nLevine then told the story of how he did the play-by-play for a high school game where the local star scored 35 points.\n\u201cOn the air, I called the wrong name all night,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out when I read the newspaper the next day. At a bigger station, I might have gotten fired. Instead, I learned a lesson about preparation and checking the numbers in the program.\u201d\nCOMING HOME\nIn 1971, Levine came back home to Northeast Ohio as sports director and sales manager of WNIR in Akron.\n\u201cI wanted to do high school basketball play-by-play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe station said if I could sell commercials for the time, they put them on the air.\u201d\nLevine picked schools in areas where he could sell his spots to local businesses. He later did Kent State football. He was making $100 a week as sports director, plus $25 per high school game. His real money came from selling commercials.\nHe wanted to build a career in Northeast Ohio.\n\u201cMy goal was to do college games by the time I was 25, and get a pro job by 30,\u201d he said.\nOver the years, Levine did play-by-play for Kent State and Cleveland State. He applied for several pro team radio jobs, but they never materialized.\nThose jobs are hard to secure. The voices of the teams tend to stay on the job, seemingly for an eternity. For example, it\u2019s harder to be a big league broadcaster than a player, at least in terms of beating the odds.\nThe Indians have two radio voices, and they have five on TV (counting the shows before and after games). So that\u2019s seven, compared to 25 players on a roster.\n\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as the guy hiring for the job thinks you are,\u201d said Levine.\nAt different stages of his career, Levine has done pre-game and post-game shows for the Browns, Indians and Cavs games for various media outlets. He did Cleveland Crusaders hockey for a few years.\nHe also writes a column for the Cleveland Jewish News. Levine is a gifted writer. He spends about 15 minutes composing his nightly Voice of Truth & Reason commentaries.\n\u201cHe keeps re-creating himself,\u201d said Mike Bacon.\nBut his real calling has been call-in talk shows.\n\u201cAnd never in my life did I ever call a talk show,\u201d he said, laughing.\nLevine still is heard filling in for various hosts on 92.3 FM in Cleveland.\nMORE SPORTS, MORE LES\nIn 1996, Steve Liverani of SportsChannel had the idea of Levine taking his More Sports & Les Levine radio show from WHK to cable television. It\u2019s been around in some form on some media outlet ever since, including his pun-style How Come Quickies:\n\u201cHow come a deer knows where to cross?\u201d Levine once wondered.\nLevine often has sports writers and broadcasters on his show. I\u2019ve been a periodic guest for more than 20 years. One of his gifts is making people feel comfortable and important.\nLevine sells his own commercials. It\u2019s a way of being his own boss.\n\u201cListen to how he works his commercials into his show,\u201d said his daughter, Jamie. \u201cThere\u2019s an art to it. There\u2019s timing. My father can do so much more than sports.\u201d\nMany of the companies have been with him for more than a decade.\n\u201cMy father is a good salesman because he\u2019s himself,\u201d said his son, Jeremy Levine. \u201cHe talks sports. He listens. He has a natural curiosity and really cares about his sponsors and their businesses. I went on a lot of sales calls with him when I was growing up.\u201d\nHis children have wonderful memories.\n\u201cMy dad took me to see Darren Tillis and Franklin Edwards play for CSU,\u201d said Jeremy.\n\u201cHe\u2019d come to my violin recitals,\u201d said Jamie.\nTHE FIRST DATE\nLes and Allison have been married for 20 years.\n\u201cWe first met at Ohio State,\u201d said Allison. \u201cWe married other people.\u201d\nBoth later were divorced and revived their friendship.\n\u201cOur first date was to watch a Cleveland State basketball game,\u201d she said Allison, who for 28 years worked for the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland.\nHow romantic?\n\u201cI love sports,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up with boys. Browns, Indians, Cavs . . . I follow them all. There are times when I want to talk sports and Les doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have fans come up to me and ask what Les thinks of the Indians. At first, I\u2019d tried to tell them what I thought Les would say. Now, I just given them my opinion.\u201d\nAllison laughs.\n\u201cI love sports, but it\u2019s not the most important thing in life,\u201d she said.\nWHEN LIFE HITS\nThe Levine family at times has felt as if it\u2019s auditioning for the role of the Biblical character Job, who dealt with so much suffering.\n\u201cThere was a point where I was afraid to answer the phone when they called from home,\u201d said daughter Jamie, a professor of Public Affairs at IUPUI in Indianapolis.\nIn 2008, Jeremy\u2019s wife (Ali) was diagnosed with cancer. She was 32, he was 34. They had a 2-year-old son named Noah.\n\u201cIt was a rare form of gastric cancer,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cMostly it hits elderly Asian men. That became a joke between us.\u201d\nJamie recalled how Noah fell down and broke his femur while Ali was battling cancer in the hospital.\n\u201cThat\u2019s also when Dad had hurt his quad muscles and needed surgery,\u201d she said.\nAli lived for 11 months.\n\u201cIn the final week of her life, she had me sit on the edge of the bed,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cAli told me that she wanted me to the remarry. I didn\u2019t want to talk about that. She kept saying, \u2018You\u2019ll find someone, and it will good\u2026\u2019 \u201c\nJeremy choked up a bit as he told the story of becoming a single dad, and how family members helped. In 2012, he remarried. Now he and Melissa have a daughter.\n\u201cThat was so hard,\u201d said Levine. \u201cIt was worse than anything I\u2019ve been going through. I learned so much from watching Jeremy at that time.\u201d\nTwo years ago, Allison was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is clear now.\n\u201cLes can drive me crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell me not to lift heavy things. He\u2019ll tell me not to cook too much \u2014 like that is going to bring back the cancer. I swear, he acts like a little old woman around me at times.\u201d\nAllison laughed again.\nWHAT REALLY MATTERS\nA few months after Allison\u2019s was diagnosed with cancer, Levine began to have trouble walking.\n\u201cI noticed a slight tremor in his hands,\u201d said Allison.\nIt took a while, but Levine was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\nThe husband and wife knew little about it. The reports on the internet were scary.\n\u201cI\u2019m in stage one,\u201d said Levine. \u201cI\u2019m doing OK.\u201d\nMedication and an exercise program have helped. The disease was caught early.\n\u201cNo one gives you a handbook for how to deal with cancer, the death of a wife or what I\u2019m going through,\u201d said Levine. \u201cYou can ask questions like \u2018Why?\u2019 Sometimes, there are no answers.\u201d\nThe Levine family focuses on \u201cdoing what is next,\u201d said Jeremy.\nHe talked about how his father has survived for 50 years in the media business. And how his family has come through Parkinson, cancer and the death of a young woman.\nThere have been long nights staring at the ceiling. There have been tears. There has been frustration.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t give up,\u201d said Jeremy.\nLes has not missed any shows due to the Parkinson\u2019s.\n\u201cBut I know it can become a problem,\u201d he said.\nHe sat down with his producers both for the Cleveland.com show and 92.3 FAN.\n\u201cI need to know if I\u2019m losing it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell me. I don\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201d\nMike and David Bacon both were overwhelmed during that discussion.\n\u201cHe is as sharp as ever,\u201d said David Bacon.\nSo at the age of 72, Les Levine goes on\u2026talking sports.\n\u201cEvery morning, I ask Les what he\u2019s grateful for each day,\u201d said Allison. \u201cI wake up thinking of something to be thankful about. I push him to do the same. We\u2019ve had a tough few years, but we have so much to be thankful for.\u201d\nAnd so do the sports fans of Cleveland, who can still get a some more of Les Levine on the air.\n", "domain": "cleveland.com", "title": "Les Levine opens up about Parkinson\u2019s as he\u2019s honored for radio career \u2013 Terry Pluto", "date": "April 07, 2019", "authors": "Terry Pluto, The Plain Dealer", "ind30k": 174, "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/sports/2019/04/les-levine-opens-up-about-parkinsons-as-hes-honored-for-radio-career-terry-pluto.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.0968046650936226}
{"article": "Not everyone plans to dedicate their entire adulthood to love and life, but Dolly Parton has no problem embracing it. According to the country superstar, she got tattoos in order to cover up the scars she got after being shot while attempting to break up a bar fight back in 1974, which left her with damage to her wrists, pelvis and both arms.\nIn a recent conversation with Just Jared Jr., Parton revealed that the first tattoo she had done was a new symbol for the kind of love she's looking for now in her relationship. \"That's a heart, and for love,\" she explained. \"I got that for my husband, and for our loved ones.\"\nIndeed, the image resembles the loving hearts that hung in parts of her home during her time as a single woman before her husband of four decades, Carl Dean, and their four children. However, she explained to the magazine that this particular heart has a little bit more meaning: \"I've got a little heart for Carl,\" she adds. \"He's my favorite person.\"\nIn addition to the placement of the tattoo, Parton says that the color is symbolic of the couple's near 50-year partnership. \"I just love the way it's...it's yellow, and that means he's just on fire, and the flames,\" she explains. \"It kind of says it all.\"\nThe singer and her longtime love have four children together, Aly, Jamie Lynn , Emma and Jolene. In recent years, Parton has had two grandchildren as well: Jolene is the product of her marriage to Dean.\nWhile Parton never wanted to rush into marriage, it took a man with \"the same big 'ol heart\" that she has been with in her current marriage for a long time before she finally decided to take her final step to expressing her love for Dean.\n\"I was dating somebody else at the time,\" she recalls. \"He kept calling me every day, and they always said, 'The divorce is coming. The divorce is coming,' and I finally said, 'Nope. I'm not doing it!'\"\nThe singer went on to thank her then-boyfriend for standing by her when she realized that it wasn't the right time to make the decision, even if it was just for the sake of the relationship. \"He kept asking me the same question -- if it was going to happen,\" she explains. \"I finally just said, 'Because, if I don't wait, it's going to happen. It's going to happen.'

{"article": "In his unusually blunt opening statement during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg issued a loud and unmistakable admission:\n\u201cI am deeply embarrassed. It was a mistake to send me that email and I am utterly ashamed of myself. \u2026 Let me be clear: I have more love for my country than I have time and space to articulate.\u201d\nThis opened up an interesting question about Buttigieg\u2019s 2015 job application to Harvard University. The application became publicly available Monday, and is entertaining reading for anyone seeking to understand a rising star in the Democratic Party: the internal and public manifestation of a 19-year-old Buttigieg\u2019s thirst for self-improvement.\nButtigieg took that job in 2016. Since then, he has told interviews he was a \u201chard knock student\u201d (at 18, he was accepted to three different colleges, before he was accepted to Harvard), and an unhappy student (\u201cthough I did enjoy some of my classes. I think I was more like a more introverted Melinda Gates,\u201d he told Harvard Magazine).\nAdvertisement\nIn his application, he opened with an awkward recitation of his life story: his parents emigrated from the country of his ancestors, South Korea, and brought him to the United States when he was 2 years old; his Irish-Catholic mother worked as a teacher and his father had a successful career in finance. He wrote that in high school he played catcher on the baseball team, and in college, he became a hip-hop and funk DJ.\nHe said he won an award from his fraternity for his \u201cThemes of Self-Deficiency thesis,\u201d which detailed his job application, and \u201cIn depth\u201d work on it.\n\u201cAs you can imagine, I have a pretty specific idea of the things I want to add in future efforts,\u201d he wrote.\nHe detailed the conclusions he reached in writing his resume \u2014 that \u201cthere\u2019s still some work left to be done\u201d \u2014 and the justification for his decision to change jobs after undergraduate and graduate school.\nBut the most interesting section was an essay he wrote as a senior, suggesting that he was putting in extra hours at his job to improve his credit score. He also described an Internet experiment in using Coin, an electronic dollar that stores and gives you money for small purchases, in which he saw a decline in his savings.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou\u2019re right that I was fooling around,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut when I wanted to prevent myself from buying booze or pizza, I realized I\u2019d mostly wasted my time by working. I continued working \u2014 but my paycheck was stalled.\u201d\nButtigieg didn\u2019t fully articulate what he meant in the essay about his credit score. But in one interview, he told me he had a memory of his father entering into an agreement to pay a bill each month.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion in the email that they automatically set the money aside,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that I didn\u2019t have an answer for. You\u2019re all paying attention.\u201d\nNotably, in the interview, Buttigieg avoided explicitly referencing his college admission, and did not publicly disclose his student loan debt. But writing that he was applying to Harvard with an \u201cunclear\u201d credit score, that he was prepared to work late nights and \u201cbetter work on myself,\u201d that he had left something undone in a paper, and that he had checked his credit score, resulted in an unsavory admission to Harvard\u2019s extracurricular activities.\nButtigieg has rarely discussed his application, except in an early interview about his candidacy to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which he declined to run. In another interview about his ambitions, he repeatedly discussed his undergraduate work on \u201cpersonal finance\u201d (one of his current books is on education finance), and how he was not a member of the Wall Street fraternity he founded. But \u201ccredit scoring\u201d was never part of the discussion.\nAdvertisement\nButtigieg has since promoted his candidacy for president, telling The New York Times he was \u201ca legitimate candidate in the race.\u201d\n", "domain": "boston.com", "title": "What Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Harvard writings tell us about the 2020 candidate", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": "Alexander Burns, New York Times News Service", "ind30k": 153, "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/04/16/pete-buttigieg-harvard", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "\u00d7 Colts\u2019 Chris Ballard \u2018gets it,\u2019 says ESPN\u2019s Todd McShay\nINDIANAPOLIS, Ind. \u2013 The total overhaul of the Colts\u2019 coaching staff is in full-swing. The final pieces of the puzzle are in place.\nAnd they\u2019re already working with some new-look players.\nESPN\u2019s Todd McShay\u2019s latest mock draft ahead of the April 26-28 draft has Indianapolis selecting Texas Tech wide receiver Laquon Treadwell with the No. 6 overall pick, placing him alongside fellow wideouts in the West, which appears to be at its peak of the round.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s class of wide receivers is loaded,\u2019\u2019 McShay wrote. \u201cThere is versatility with some bigger, physical receivers like Treadwell, Deontay Burnett of USC and DeAndre Carter of Pitt, who can play in the slot and on the outside. And there are athletic receivers with more speed, such as Kentucky\u2019s D.J. Chark and Texas\u2019 Collin Johnson.\n\u201cFor what Indianapolis is looking for in an outside receiver, Treadwell could be the pick. He\u2019s 6-foot-2 and at 240 pounds has the size that needs to be a weapon. His 50-inch vertical shows his athleticism.\u2019\u2019\nTwo of the city\u2019s best free agents, Clayton Geathers and Malik Hooker, are expected to start in the season opener Sept. 9 against the Los Angeles Rams, and the Colts have interest in re-signing starting cornerback Rashaan Melvin. In fact, we\u2019re told they\u2019ve offered him a three-year contract worth $19 million.\nThe very next round, No. 49 overall, could land them a stellar return man in Oklahoma\u2019s J.K. Scott. His 37.2-yard average in three seasons at Oklahoma, tops among active kickers and tied for the FBS lead with Washington\u2019s Jake Browning, is a career high.\nAt his April 1 Pro Day, Scott ran the 40-yard dash in 4.43 seconds, and also had a 44.5-inch vertical leap and 10-6 broad jump.\nAs it stands, the only three wide receivers currently under contract are Donte Moncrief, Phillip Dorsett and Jordan Wilkins.\nBallard acknowledged last week that if the Colts acquire a wide receiver at No. 6, or pick one in the second or third round, they could open up a spot for offensive tackle after trading off Moncrief.\n\u201cWhoever is there, we have a plan in place,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at offensive tackle (in the second and third rounds).

{"article": "David Shepherd never once backed off when his opponents gave him a fight.\nFrom the beginning of the quarter-final, it was clear that the 47-year-old was on his game. It was obvious to everyone watching that Shepherd knew the way the ECC hitters were hitting, how to get over them, how to take them out.\nBut, it was clear that Shepherd\u2019s numbers, those great numbers that he displayed in pre-start, had nothing to do with how good he was hitting the ball.\nShepherd was hitting with both forces and finesse, just as he was in the Super Six playdowns, too.\nWhen the time came for the paring, Shepherd was the one who knew exactly what to do.\nRight off the bat, he knew the Royals starting left-hander was hitting a right-handed line drive to centre field, before he knew where he was hitting the ball.\nInstead of accepting the hit, Shepherd knew he had to turn on the jets and go back. He immediately dived for the ball, and hit it out of the park to left field, sending his team to the championship round of the ECC playdowns.\n\u201cI knew the guy was going to hit it in centre field and I think I missed it on the first swing, but then I hit it back right away,\u201d said Shepherd. \u201cWe played the trajectory, and everything else I knew.\u201d\nWhen it came to looking at the remaining three teams, Shepherd\u2019s had his eye on the Royals in the Super Six, and when they finished the regular season with a perfect 12-0 record, there was little doubt he would face off against them again.\nAlthough, the rematch was a little different than what was expected.\nNow, Shepherd\u2019s facing against a team that had its own questions going into the season, too.\nAlthough they made it to the Super Six playoffs by finishing as the top team in the North East, the Royals finished with the fewest wins in the entire tournament at 4-4.\nBut as Shepherd showed on Wednesday, winning is not about the standings, it\u2019s about how you play, and with the exception of a three-game series against the Yellow Jackets, they seemed to pick up right where they left off last season.\nTo get to their second straight semi-final appearance, they had to go through the Prince Albert Major Babe Ruth League North Central Division champions.\nLast year, the Royals didn\u2019t have the group they have this year, it wasn\u2019t the same team, and they weren\u2019t on the same page.\nBut with the group they have now, the Royals\u2019 came back swinging and did not disappoint.\nAs their two-game series against the NWBB Giants finished, their ace pitcher, Ryan Joyner, gave up just three hits, one walk and one run in a complete-game, one-hit shutout, while not allowing a hit to the Giants\u2019 top hitter, from 2014.\nEven though the Giants scored two early runs on Wednesday, the Royals rallied and scored three runs of their own in the bottom of the third, with the winner coming in the bottom of the fifth, which gave Shepherd an early 5-2 lead.\nWith the Royals coming back against Stony Plain to advance to the semi-finals, taking out the Giants was important to not only going deep into the tournament, but also making sure the Royals got the chance to go back and play against Shepherd in the championship game.\nShepherd is not a two-hit pitcher, so it was a matter of saving Joyner to go into a game against Stoney Plain with a comfortable lead, when they knew they had a great chance to get the first baseman to the semi-finals.\nInstead, Shepherd showed once again why the Royals knew he was going to be a tough matchup once they got to the final game.\nBoth the Royals and the Pelicans played four complete games, and although the two teams split their series, Shepherd still had to go out and earn his shot at the championship game.\nBut rather than getting comfortable in his start, he worked even harder on just getting better. He put in the extra time to train the next day to get even more strong, and that was more than enough to come out on top.\nIn the end, Shepherd\u2019s dominance in the area just keeps on coming.\nE-mail: hillsyjay@gmail.com\nOn Twitter: @hillsyjay\n", "domain": "edmontonjournal.com", "title": "Results: David Shepherd handily hangs on to Edmonton-City Centre", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 5992, "url": "https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/edmonton-city-centre-david-shepherd-handily-hangs-on-to-downtown-riding", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

However, despite this, the stock of investments in the country is only 10 per cent of the total foreign direct investment flowing into the EU.\n\u201cWe hope that the current trend of generating foreign direct investment, particularly in tourism and service sectors, will be maintained.\u201d he said.\nReinforcing the commitment to cohesion and solidarity in Cyprus, Anastasiades said that the citizens\u2019 economic problems can be solved by working in a way that limits the burden on the state.\nHe said this can be done by committing ourselves, in cooperation with all stakeholders, to the application of the principles of social progress, integrity, competitiveness and trust, and through adopting policies that allow all citizens, families and businesses to survive and generate their own future.\n\u201cIt is also our duty, as state members, to protect the country\u2019s reputation in this respect, and build on our friendship and ties with the main oil producers, which allow us to pursue a shared path in the field of security, energy and conflict management,\u201d he added.\nAs regards the Cyprus issue, Anastasiades emphasised that the \u201cbridge\u201d to peace has been built but that there is a need to build a bridge, and only this bridge can overcome the obstacles on the path toward a lasting and comprehensive settlement.\nAnastasiades noted that there is a constructive mood among the parties on the issue, and they are sitting at the table to achieve a solution.\nIn this connection, he recalled that the President of the EU Council Donald Tusk will host the next round of talks with his counterpart Anastasiades in Brussels on April 23.\nHe referred to the important progress achieved in the border on the Stathis Georgiades bridge, as well as the efforts in dispelling the Turkish Cypriot illusions, which would allow the work of implementing the UN sponsored roadmap, for which the EU has been the force behind the process.\n\u201cThe UK government remains steadfast in this respect and seeks a fair settlement in Cyprus, a solution that will ensure the full reunification of the island and peace and stability in the EU\u201d Anastasiades said.\n", "domain": "cyprus-mail.com", "title": "President reiterates is creating conditions for economic growth", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Cna News Service", "ind30k": 9095, "url": "https://cyprus-mail.com/2019/04/12/president-reiterates-is-creating-conditions-for-economic-growth/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

It started with buying power from a utility in Seattle for one of its stores.\n\"That was the first store that we had full energy on solar and we have had that ever since,\" Hicks said. \"We added more today and we are able to deliver more of a savings because the system is larger.\"\n\"There is cost savings to be had by taking advantage of the sun for our own stores.\"\nStarbucks is using the solar panels to power the shade tent in its Tylenol, Walgreens and North Texas Market stores in Arlington, Garland, Euless, McKinney, Sunnyvale, Wylie and Plano.\n\"Our all-day energy needs are about 220 MW,\" Hicks said. \"So this project will only be supplying 7 percent of our electricity needs.\"\nThe company also said last week that it will extend its $100 million program to train workers to install rooftop solar panels.

At today\u2019s Google I/O developer conference, the Mountain View company debuted new cloud services integrations \u2014 Caavo Connect to G Suite apps and Caavo Mobile Connect for Android \u2014 which promise to give parents more granular control over how their children access apps on the go.\nThe Caavo Connect app \u2014 available on Android, iOS, and in the Web app \u2014 lets you create profiles for each individual account. Parents can also launch it directly from their Google accounts to view child profiles. Caavo Connect itself is free, but additional plans to monitor use are available for a monthly fee.\nThe latest Caavo app is a dead ringer for its Google I/O debut last year. It features a new Control Center, where you can start, stop, or mute the alarm, upload new event photos, or view recent apps. A do-not-disturb mode lets parents restrict the time kids can access certain apps \u2014 or temporarily block them altogether. A new mobile app is equipped with a powerful night mode that reduces notifications to a dull hum until it\u2019s time to sleep. And the cloud-based Parental Controls tool keeps watch on everything from location history and app usage to messages and calls.\nCaavo\u2019s enabled parental control feature appears on the watchface, the app\u2019s icon on Android and iOS, and on settings on Android, iOS, and the Web.\nCaavo isn\u2019t the only one competing in the parental control space. Video tracking tool ViziSafe, launched last summer, lets parents manage time, contacts, texts, and GPS location on iOS and Android devices. And a slew of parental controls startups have emerged in recent years, including Zuga, Mobile Forensics, and Arkavu.\nCaavo is also competing with more established players. Security analytics firm Lookout, for example, rolled out a dashboard called Lookout Child to Android last fall. And Besso, a browser-agnostic internet dashboard for kids, recently announced a revised version of its software for Android and iOS, alongside an iOS app that includes \u201csexting\u201d checklists.\nCaavo\u2019s parental control features will work with Google OTA updates, beginning in May. Users will be able to set defaults based on time and day, and the data they aggregate will be archived in Caavo\u2019s cloud.\n\u201cParents today are overwhelmed with questions on how to raise responsible tech consumers \u2014 whether it\u2019s protecting their children from the dangers of tech, managing child spending or better setting boundaries and expectations around online communications,\u201d said Tauba Auerbach, CEO of Caavo. \u201cWe\u2019re giving parents a new way to make decisions with data, tools, and tools that work with them.\u201d\n", "domain": "venturebeat.com", "title": "Caavo gains a parental monitoring feature and OTA tuner integration", "date": "April 02, 2019", "authors": "Kyle Wiggers", "ind30k": 2388, "url": "https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/02/caavo-gains-a-parental-monitoring-feature-support-for-tivo-dvrs-and-ota-tuner-integration/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "In my opinion we are stuck in the place we have been for several years now - except for some potential breaking out to the upside, mostly on bad economic news. The strong upper, is unweighed by the weak lower, as aggregate aggregate monetary growth remains soft.\nFor readers on the non-economist list, and my collection of friends on the economist list, an explanation of the chasm in economic and financial analysis is here. My conclusion:\nOur economic and financial system are priced for static periods, or how the investor expects to behave during the available period (or immediately preceding a given economic expansion). If the index \"investment\" fell into recession, then the stock market got punished and the economy also fell into recession (i.e. downturn). If investors expected the same investment growth over the next few years, and their expectations were matched by the market, investors would be rewarded and would expect business growth to be stronger, and the economy to be stronger. (This is how stock prices rose, accompanied by widening of spreads between asset classes).\nSomething has changed since 1999, and stocks continued their expansion for another decade. The strong stock returns followed by the strong real returns is a testimony to the unsustainable investment assumptions, the credit that inflation did not result in current prices, that productivity was just beginning to grow over the past decade, and that the output gap was closed, more quickly than actual economic growth.\nWe have continued the same type of patterns the past ten years with flat or negative, economic growth. Same with productivity growth. Those that have been investing in speculative assets, have been rewarded, and the economy has not performed up to par. Similarly the economy also has not performed up to par.\nHousing continues to retreat, as compared to building the supply. The problem is that from the time home prices peaked until today, the housing investment and home sales increase the GDP.\nUnemployment and the underemployment rate is simply a size of jobs reports, which is easy to fake, but if the jobs are not being created, then the measure is useful as a bellwether for the rest of the economy. It is consistent with slower economic growth.\nThe real complicating factor in all of this is our national and global balance sheets that increase leverage, and added liabilities, as a result of mortgage payments. Credit card debt is the fastest growing category, and is not taking advantage of economic growth.\nBy measure of household debt, which is the fundamental of our economy, the financial balance sheets of the household are sound, but worse than in past episodes when comparable debt was at much higher risk levels. Household indebtedness, is an important measure of the health of the consumer sector. It is at elevated levels and the speed at which it has increased is concerning. Households have taken advantage of a slow and sustainable growth period to leverage up, and the growing debt level suggests this is not sustainable.\nI cannot be so cynical about the government spending and tax policies on the surface. Therefore I focus instead on the following concerns.\nFederal government debt is already so high, that recent action to fund it, while on an improving revenue and growth path is inadequate, to finance the debt load. The only way to address the debt and deficit is to raise taxes or cut spending. Cutting spending would be pretty unpopular, especially in political districts with large military populations. Corporate growth is tepid, and it has been unable to address the outstanding debt and deficit due to the reluctance of the financial sector to invest.\nThere are three areas in which Washington is irrelevant and no longer appropriate. This is an opinion supported by most of the commentary. This is my opinion supported by the recently passed omnibus spending bill (through Jan. 1, 2013), and the stagnant housing numbers, and the lack of innovation in the agricultural sector of the economy. I would give us 6 or 8 weeks to a month to see what direction we should take to take some of the uncertainty out of the political decisions the United States makes.\nOur nation has benefitted from a comfortable level of debt that investors are willing to hold for extended periods. It is at unprecedented levels, and this is not sustainable. This status quo will be uncomfortable, especially if our markets turn in another three years.\nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n", "domain": "seekingalpha.com", "title": "Weekly Economic Release Summary: Continuing Soft Economic Growth With Some Contraction", "date": "April 06, 2019", "authors": "Steven Hansen, Global Economic Intersection", "ind30k": 4354, "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4253069-weekly-economic-release-summary-continuing-soft-economic-growth-contraction", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

(Photo: PTI)\nWe have a visible political divide of social classes in this country. Nationalistic ideological positions are taken over political differences. This forces education to be seen solely as the path to government service in order to be accepted. Attempts are made to introduce fundamentalism to education, aiming at attracting every child towards nationalism and its administrative apparatus. Education functions in keeping with this ideology.\nWhile all parents and teachers would have their subjective take on the issue, I do not see anything wrong in our country\u2019s education system being replete with National-Socialist concepts. At a societal level, children must be given incentives and opportunities to learn in areas of their interest and interest of their parents. In such a situation, there are such private schools catering to the socio-economic needs of the poor, and other such schools have strength in a whole host of other classes that include inclusive education.\nWhere does this expose the one who is a chief minister or the prime minister? Did my nationalistic education kill the love for learning that I had at the age of 5 years and 6 years? It has not. I had a tutor, and we also had an English tutor. We not only did well in exams in our official schools, we also participated and won in literary competitions.\nI do not think so. On the contrary, my politics and nationalism from childhood has flourished into an extension of my love for writing. I also remember that early on in my schooling days, I was one of the only political leaders in school. I used to publish my writing, and even to this day, I still have a writing page on my personal page on Facebook.\nIs it because of the nationalism that I was not fluent in English? Of course not. It was the interest that I found in life. It was the deep interest in words that helped me to find natural ways to conduct my own politics at the age of 12. Since then, I have a keen interest in languages and I speak a bit of them.\nIn English, the interest involved was pride in the word itself. I have no words to express the kind of pleasure I derive when hearing that my child has mentioned the word \u2018bedaayai\u2019 in a writing. In another language, this word has completely lost its meaning. So, having a limited understanding of a language is a blessing, not a curse. Many other issues matter more to me than linguistic proficiency.\nThe larger problem here is that all those who come after us would not just make nationalistic teaching and learning more efficient, but also incorporate the ideas that have arisen at a personal level in the form of young, dynamic, broad-minded leaders.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo This Georgetown charting \u2018path forward\u2019 after reparations vote\nAfter coming under fire from Jewish groups, Georgetown University is drawing up a response to the House of Representatives' passage of a bill that would establish a mechanism for the university to compensate victims of slavery.\n\u201cGeorgetown University continues to view slavery as a transatlantic tragedy and has a long history of examining our own institution in light of our past,\u201d the university announced Monday in a statement distributed by Georgetown spokeswoman Lauren Rothman. \u201cAs a university, we are grateful to the Jewish community for its important leadership on this issue, and we are actively working to identify and define our path forward.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nIn a statement last week, Temple University President Milton Skolnick called on the university to make amends.\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

In a statement published by CNN last week, Georgetown University President John DeGioia said the school does not plan to apologize to victims of slavery, but he stressed that the school is \"committed to learning from its history.\"\n\"The United States was the globe\u2019s leading slave-trading nation for more than 400 years, from colonial times to the end of the Civil War in 1865, and more than 11 million people were enslaved on U.S. land,\" he said. \"Despite their incredible harm to African-Americans, our country\u2019s collective traumas from slavery have been considered settled for many. That is not the case here.\"\nHe later added: \"We understand that in the Jewish community, the passage of this legislation has been met with dismay and disappointment. It is not our intention to cause harm to anyone, and we regret that this has happened. We also respect the principle of recognition and forgiveness, and sincerely hope that our actions inspire others to do the same. But it is important to know that our position is consistent with a vast majority of modern American opinion and history.\u201d\nIn a letter to Georgetown released Saturday, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund called on the university to confront its history of slavery.\n\u201cResolution of the questions of restitution and reparations for slave descendants and slave owners should be an objective of institutions with one overarching goal: the continuing success of people of African descent,\u201d LDF board Chair Wendy E. Katten wrote in the letter. \u201cIt should not be a potential source of embarrassment and pain for institutions.\u201d\nYikes. @miltonskolnick and others are sounding off on the House slave reparations vote, urging @GeorgetownU to use this moment to bridge divisions, make amends, and bring healing.

{"article": "Share\nFor several months now, there have been rumors of a springtime 2018 refresh for Apple\u2019s lineup of MacBook Pros, with some projecting the models would be announced as early as May. Those plans, it now appears, may be derailed to some degree. The newly refreshed machines may launch as late as June, 2017.\nThe reason for the delay is that we may have been left with too little material to make the machines look as gorgeous as possible. According to sources cited by TechRadar, Apple did cut some colors from the palette for the new models, resulting in some boards that weren\u2019t as eye-catching as the company hoped.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Apple has had to make some room for inventory after the much-rumored refresh. A similar issue delayed the arrival of the 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro, which was actually unveiled before the previously anticipated March debut. The 15-inch MacBook Pro, which had been officially been delayed for over a year, did see a speedy refresh. The only model that didn\u2019t see the latest changes was the all-metal 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which received a reprieve until 2019.\nEven so, just a handful of colors have apparently left a deeper impression on Apple than it wanted. Apple has apparently not updated its upcoming lineup for some time, which resulted in a challenge for some of the company\u2019s design staff: how to conjure up the graphics and texture needed for an ideal user experience when all the colors were simply black.\nWhile an all-black MacBook Pro may no longer be imminent, it won\u2019t be the case for long. The upcoming redesigns will include an introduction of a less expensive MacBook Pro with a touchscreen display, as well as an upgrade to a smaller version of the MacBook Air. Since the updated MacBook Air will have only a 4K display, a change to Apple\u2019s MacMini is also rumored, as well as a bump to 16GB of RAM as an option on all models.\nApple previously acknowledged that it had more work to do to make the new MacBook Pros \u201cultimate,\u201d and the company\u2019s upcoming redesigns will no doubt be improved by the company\u2019s feedback on how customers have responded to the current generation. Of course, it\u2019s not all bad news for Apple fans, since the timing of the 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro update, a rumored refresh of the 12-inch MacBook, and the arrival of a single larger 15-inch MacBook Pro means an influx of new models will soon be available.\n", "domain": "digitaltrends.com", "title": "Apple's new 16-inch MacBook Pro Might be Delayed to 2021", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "Hillary Grigonis, Aj Dellinger, Chuong Nguyen, Lucas Coll, Mark Coppock, Jon Martindale, Luke Larsen, Digital Trends Staff, Will Fulton, Anita George", "ind30k": 1643, "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-delayed-until-2021/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "In a move that will set precedents in the world of politics, the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, announced during the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) President\u2019s Australia Day Celebrations, that his country will implement a financial transaction tax (FTT) for the first time. It will be for a minimum of 0.05%. Apart from reducing inequality in a country, a further addition to its economic growth through easing in tax payments to Government treasury is likely to follow. In addition, this measure will surely take India\u2019s global role among the business and investment communities further, as some of the major countries of the world including the US and UK have embraced the FTT principle to stem the outflow of capital from their economy.\nRising inequality of wealth among the masses is a global phenomenon. It is seen in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa, UAE, Kuwait, Egypt, Algeria, Germany, US, Austria, UK, France, Ireland, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, UK, Germany, Slovenia, France, Spain, Italy, and Australia. International analysis based on Global Wealth Database indicates that India ranks as the fourth poorest country in terms of the absolute amount of wealth held by the bottom 40% of the population, as compared to other countries such as Indonesia, UAE, Brazil, UK, and Chile. While in India, inequality of wealth is a lot greater than in other countries, the level of inequality could be significantly reduced by a 1% FTT. From a global perspective, India stands amongst the top five countries in terms of the amount of wealth held by the bottom 40% of its population.\nMoney has been transferred and moved to a variety of places including the stock exchanges and bankers\u2019 offices on the speculative bets on the liquidity of various markets, and in the case of sale and purchase of securities, such as stocks and bonds. One can easily point out that this is nothing short of financial speculation \u2013 a practice which is linked to the socio-economic underdevelopment of many countries. This is a matter of concern for all members of the global community. India finds itself in the group of countries which have the highest level of financial speculation and speculative transactions in the world, being ranked amongst the 10 worst nations in terms of this matter. As per the report of the Office of Financial Research in the UK, from 2013 to 2017, \u201c1.3 per cent of all global GDP was invested in the stock market. This is much higher than the 1 per cent reported in 2010 and the 0.6 per cent reported in 2000.\u201d This implies that financial speculation is at a similar level as it was in 2000. All of this has raised doubts over the sustainability of the financial system on which the economy in India runs on a daily basis. And these doubts pose a risk for the emerging economies such as India.\nThere are other aspects of the economic situation in India which should be of keen interest to global markets and financial institutions as well as on the national level. Key among these is the fact that India\u2019s financial literacy, in terms of its capacity to respond to risks, has been getting worse over the years. A recent Research Report by Corporate Corner, on the \u201cAccountability of Placing or Not to Peculiar Risk Management Practices,\u201d has been of great relevance. For instance, \u201cthe cost of mispricing financial risk by banks (cost of default) is 6% of their assets.\u201d These reports have also highlighted the issue of \u201cProfit before risk,\u201d and how often financial entities, including banks, behave this way. However, \u201cthe level of profit is not linked to the ability to identify and reduce risk.\u201d It is the same report which has also highlighted that \u201c\u2018Financial literacy is really important,\u2019 said Marko Popovic, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s director of innovation and venture management in the department of accounting, finance and economics.\u201d It is quite interesting to note that, this research project is sponsored by the Voluntary Professional Testing Scheme, which is a voluntary reporting mechanism for making financial literacy a prerequisite for the signing up for bank accounts.\nAt the macroeconomic level, India\u2019s financial system is plagued with the problem of too much dependence on private and public debt to finance the deficit, and consumption. Such a situation entails risk to public finances and therefore hampers domestic investment. FUTURE INDICATORS (online) in its recent publication on \u201cAsset bubbles and financial instability\u201d has underscored the importance of \u201cimproving the financial literacy and wealth management in India.\u201d This short survey report has also concluded by observing that, the \u201cStructural problems in Indian banking, the impact of the Finance Sector Reform", "domain": "globalresearch.ca", "title": "The Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) - Global Research", "date": "April 02, 2019", "authors": "Kavaljit Singh", "ind30k": 4899, "url": "https://www.globalresearch.ca/why-us-needs-financial-transaction-tax/5673391", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nWhen it comes to the loss of Jedi, especially just days before a new Star Wars trilogy starts, fans are more than willing to forgive or even forget. But the franchise's authors still aren't on board with the loss of Jedi to Death Star space station, a task that could easily be handled by a simple command of \"Force Push!\" rather than turning off both Jedi Watch and Jedi Mind Trick systems.\nBut as the Star Wars novel Dark Disciple may have laid bare, there was a simpler, easier solution to the Jedi extermination which Force users on the surface could take solace in: a single Force Flood will do it. One used to flood Jedi Watch and Jedi Mind Trick systems with an uncontrolled amount of Force. In other words, an episode of Riverdale.\nIf the idea is going to be taken up with a pair of novels in the new Star Wars canon, then fans will need to expect more detail on how General Grievous managed to kill so many Jedi, and single-handedly eliminate so many times the amount of Force control.\nAdmittedly, those comic fans who are unfamiliar with \"Dark Disciple\" should rest assured that it is not what those critics might think it is. This is a new and extended version of the canonical prequel tale which has long been out of print. And while it does reveal some disturbing revelations about the Emperor's plans, the main insight on Grievous is the same that was demonstrated by Obi-Wan in the original film.\nThe fact that Grievous didn't receive the Jedi's attention in his time on the base means that in some way, Obi-Wan had an idea ahead of time of what Grievous was capable of. Whether that is not yet realizing that this was the Reaper he had been chasing on New Hope, or possessing the power to take what he needed to, and carry it with him... fans will have to tune in to find out.\nIt doesn't take much time to do some reading between the lines of Dark Disciple, especially when you see the waves of Force floods Grievous managed to trigger on its surface and beyond. So despite the chance to see more of the 'Separatist' politician/warlord/smuggler in a roundhouse-kick to the Jedi's necks, it's not shocking that he didn't get that far. Especially when you learn that as a far younger, self-taught Force user, Grievous' only contribution to the name 'Grievous' was to murder an entire species.\nThere may be an allusion to that point when new Empire: Princes and Princesses saga (suggesting a Grievous who grew up knowing only death) weaves together the Rebels' future foe, a Force Stormtrooper, and his grandfather. But readers of the New Original Trilogy as well will want to check out this digital teaser:\nThe message on the bumper can only be read if the new novel is purchased digitally, but those with a Star Wars subscription can download it outright (in 'real' paper, as opposed to digital), ahead of the print release on the following day.\nIt's an eerie prophecy, revealing that 'when dark lords rise, something evil and horrible happens to good humans.' That something evil and horrible turned out to be Grievous - the design, charisma, and physical qualities of the ideal creature for the Sith Senate to infest and control. And to understand just how, what, or how many 'good humans' he killed, we also need to look at the prequel material which tells the Star Wars saga's previous generations of Jedi:\nAs the saga shows, Jedi were better at resisting Force flood just as they were better at going through Trials of the Temple on New Hope. Only if their presence was more frequent and the mission less structured, could they hold on. But at some point, they vanished from the surface so quickly that the Sith rulers just assumed the Jedi died.\nAfter the destruction of the Jedi Temple on Mustafar, several new young Jedi and returning Jedi were considered to be lost. That's why, when Grievous assaulted the New New Hope star destroyer, Obi-Wan and his allies were able to defeat the general without any discernible loss of their own force powers.\n1 2\nFrozen 2 Trailer Sets All-Time Views Record for Animated Movie\n", "domain": "screenrant.com", "title": "Star Wars Explains How General Grievous Killed So Many Jedi", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "Andrew Dyce", "ind30k": 4410, "url": "https://screenrant.com/star-wars-general-grievous-killed-jedi/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Hancock Family Trust\n, a holding company, issued a 12,000,000 one-year investment trust in 2010 at $10 per common share. The family got great rates of return, but has since made up the value loss.\n(Below is a story I wrote for the family about the plight of elderly parents taking up residence with young adult grandchildren.)\nThe line between a meaningful investment of time and a purely liquid investment has blurred. Today, many personal investments don\u2019t fit neatly into either category. This has led to higher costs of investment, higher household expenses, and lower asset growth.\nThere are many ways that assets are treated for investment purposes. Right now, almost every investment fund manager has a suite of actively managed funds that pay out large dividend distributions. These are great at capturing capital appreciation by investing primarily in equities. However, the undistributed capital generated by the equity income is not typically captured through tax purposes or with the portfolio\u2019s interest rates, other than using it to pay for some of the cost of the dividend. This adds up.\nBy reinvesting these dividend distributions, investors are getting more money back into their holdings. However, the additional dollars are taxed twice: they are taxed at a higher rate on the original dividend and again at the higher rate on the extra funds. By contrast, if someone stays out of the market and utilizes the dividend money to purchase stocks, there is no tax on the dividends and capital gains would be tax-free. This is a stark contrast from a sensible income portfolio that invests in bonds, GICs, or annuities.\nAnother group of folks are engaged in income investing. These are individuals who work hard for a large income. While this isn\u2019t an easy life to live, it\u2019s not as taxing as an individual who receives a pension and receives income on top of it. At the same time, couples have kids, and as the grandchildren grow older, the grandparents are also moving into residence. In many cases, neither the parents nor grandparents are getting sufficient retirement income to maintain themselves and their homes. There is often little oversight in terms of the amount of income received by the spouses, nor how this is allocated. The results? Household debt levels are soaring, and, when matters get complicated, you run a higher risk of having your assets frozen by the government.\nThere are some successful income-focused investment strategies that help ensure the benefits of income investing can be enjoyed. These include using a non-registered account, holding cash in segregated funds, investing only in low-risk securities that contain \u201cfree-floating\u201d cash flows, building a high-yield ladder, or investing in REITs and MLPs, which generally offer tax-free yields.\nInvestors also have to understand that there is no such thing as a low-risk asset class. Corporate debt, for example, is much riskier than equities. There are no clear winners and losers when interest rates rise, and there are potentially large losses when interest rates crash.\nThe only sure way to protect your capital is to stay in the market. By following this advice, you will be on the path to getting a comfortable living, preserving your capital, and in the meantime maximizing your portfolio\u2019s potential growth.\nRaymond James Ltd.

{"article": "Lawyers, medical experts and academics have criticised a special select committee set up to review the Death with Dignity Bill, which could legalise euthanasia.\nPhoto: RNZ / Richard Tindiller\nThe bill, tabled in Parliament in March, would allow doctors to prescribe and administer lethal medications to terminal patients who had two doctors' witnesses to say they were clearly free of mental illness.\nThe committee, which includes Justice Minister Andrew Little, has called for submissions on the bill, and is due to report back in July.\nHobbyist Gai Thompson, a proponent of voluntary euthanasia, said the bill had a huge loophole in it.\nThe changes would allow those suffering from severe mental illnesses to be given a prescription but not medical help to die, she said.\n\"People in that state are best left in their homes and we certainly don't leave them there, and that's why we keep medical staff on standby in case they become unwell or not.\n\"But even that, if it's an abusive or mentally ill spouse or parents or that sort of thing, they still have to leave and go into nursing homes or other institutions.\"\nNganne Leatham-Hain said the bill did not make patients sicker.\n\"By saying 'this is not euthanasia' it says you're allowed to die and you can be killed even though you are still fully capable of experiencing pain and suffering and also still have the desire to be kept alive.\"\nMany patients were incapable of giving consent for euthanasia and instead still want to be kept alive, she said.\nThe bill also recommended the Elder Abuse and Sex Crimes Bill be repealed, and said euthanasia would not be a criminal offence for a range of other crimes.\nBut the law reform institute Lord knows Right Legal Clinic said there was too much grey area about euthanasia's legalities.\n\"I don't think that's the purpose of having a select committee review,\" law professor Nicholas Johnston said.\n\"There's lots of debate about whether this will be legal in certain jurisdictions, but it should be illegal here,\" he said.\n\"We should decide that through the democratic processes, but there's already a number of barriers in place to make that difficult.\"\nProf Johnston said the bill was unlikely to pass parliament, and most of its recommendations would require the government to enact new legislation.\n\"It's not an accurate reflection of the consensus in society that it's what we want.\"\nMedical Research Foundation chief executive Louise Kiernan said the bill did not give medical professionals enough power.\n\"Medical professionals already have extensive power to help people in their most vulnerable moments, but the current bill gives them little to no power to do so.\"\nDr Kiernan said many health professionals supported voluntary euthanasia.\n\"I've seen many professionals who are pro-euthanasia, but only if they can use a little bit of power, rather than prescribing them something that would be harmful,\" she said.\nBut a not-for-profit group which helps death row prisoners said it supported the bill.\nThe prisoner assisted deaths organisation executive director Stuart Woods said he had witnessed \"brave men and women\" die through assisted suicide in Singapore, a country he said was not covered by any health laws.\nIf the New Zealand bill went ahead, the police would prosecute if the doctor \"provided the means to kill, but didn't provide the means to kill,\" he said.\n\"People would then go before a judge in a very public hearing where they'd have to plead and talk about their suffering - it'd be a big learning curve.\"\nA meeting on the bill will be held at Auckland University this afternoon, and submissions are also being accepted until 30 May.\n", "domain": "radionz.co.nz", "title": "Lawyers, academics urge scrutiny over euthanasia bill 'loopholes'", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 3933, "url": "https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/387113/lawyers-academics-urge-scrutiny-over-euthanasia-bill-loopholes", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nClinton Contractor Described \u2018Cover-up Operation Work Ticket\u2019 in Newly Uncovered Email\nA newly obtained internal message from the Denver-based Platte River Networks firm that serviced the personal email system used by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for official diplomatic business referenced a \u201cHillary cover-up operation work ticket archive cleanup,\u201d the nonprofit government watchdog Judicial Watch said on April 8.\nThe email with the cover-up reference is contained in FBI notes on a February 2016 interview of an unidentified Platte River Networks official.\nJudicial Watch obtained the notes as part of more than 400 previously unreleased FBI documents a federal district court order turned over to the nonprofit as a result of its Freedom of Information Act suit.\nIn the Dec. 11, 2014, email, an unidentified Platte River Network official told another that \u201cI\u2019m kind of freaking about Gresham. Thoughts on what to do with [name redacted].\u201d\nThe official responded: \u201cIts all part of the Hillary coverup operation. I\u2019ll have to tell you about it at the party.\u201d A smiling emoji was inserted by the responder between the two sentences.\nThe \u201cGresham\u201d reference appears to be to the Chicago-based Gresham Partners LLC. It\u2019s not clear what, if any, connection there is between that firm, which describes itself as \u201can independent investment and wealth management firm that has been serving select families, family offices and endowments since 1997,\u201d and the \u201cHillary cover-up operation.\u201d\nIn another of the newly released documents, an unidentified individual working with an inspector from the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General told a Department of State official in a June 27, 2015, email that \u201cI have personally reviewed hundreds of documents in the HRC collection. I can now say, without reservation, that there are literally hundreds of classified emails in this collection; maybe more.\u201d\nIt is not known from the documents how many emails were contained in the reviewed collection in which the classified emails were found by the unidentified individual.\nClinton has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing with the private email system, which included a server located in a bathroom in the New York mansion she shares with former President Bill Clinton.\nA year after leaving office, she turned over to the State Department an estimated 30,000 emails that her attorney David Kendall and members of her State Department staff claimed dealt with official business.\nShe claimed another 32,000 emails were personal and were destroyed using a product known as BleachBit, with no prior independent government review.\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, in a controversial, nationally televised statement, recommended against prosecuting Clinton in July 2016, but that didn\u2019t prevent crowds of supporters of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from chanting, \u201cLock her up, lock her up,\u201d during rallies before and after his election victory.\nThe Epoch Times reported Feb. 25, 2019, that the Justice Department told Comey that Clinton must have intended to compromise classified documents.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\nANAHEIM \u2014 The Angels had Mike Trout coming to the plate in just the type of situation they want to see him hit more often. As he stepped up in the third inning, the Angels had two runners on and one out.\nTrout hit into a double play.\nAfter that rare sight of Trout\u2019s fallibility, he checked the video and made some adjustments to his swing.\nHe homered each of the next two times, providing the difference in the Angels\u2019 3-1 victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night.\nThe Angels snapped a five-game losing streak, despite playing the game without three of their four best everyday players. Shohei Ohtani and Justin Upton are on the injured list, and Andrelton Simmons was out for the night because of a stiff back.\nBut the Angels had Trout, who was recognized during a pregame ceremony for winning his sixth Silver Slugger Award in 2018 and once again showed why he\u2019s the best player in the majors.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable player,\u201d said Cody Allen, who is getting his first look at Trout as a teammate. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s on our club. He kinda threw us on his back tonight.\u201d\nTrout had put on a show the night before, by hitting a monster homer and throwing out a runner at the plate. The Angels, however, still got blown out, putting a damper on their home opener.\nThis time, the night was going much better, thanks to better pitching by starter F\u00e9lix Pe\u00f1a for 4-2/3 innings and then four outs from Justin Anderson.\nWhen Trout came up in the sixth \u2013 after reviewing video and making what he called some \u201cminor\u201d adjustments \u2013 the score was tied 1-1. Lance Lynn fell behind him 2-and-0 and then threw a fastball right down the middle, and Trout blasted it over the fence in right-center.\nIn the eighth, Trout got ahead 3-and-1 and then Jesse Chavez also missed with one over the middle of the plate, which Trout didn\u2019t miss.\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to ask why anyone throws Trout a strike, especially with the rest of the lineup in its current state, Trout said he still goes up to the plate assuming he will get a good pitch.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go up there saying that they\u2019re not going to pitch to me, because then if they do throw it in there you\u2019re not going to hit it,\u201d Trout said, \u201cI\u2019ve just got the mindset that they\u2019re always going to throw to me and take my walks (when they don\u2019t). But tonight, just got in a good position to hit and I didn\u2019t miss them.\u201d\nAngels pitchers made sure three runs was enough for a victory.\nRelated Articles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs has abandoned his sinker, and he isn\u2019t alone\nMike Trout slams Angels to win over Rangers\nWatch Mike Trout\u2019s grand slam for the Angels in 4th inning against Drew Smyly, Rangers\nSaving it for 50 years: How baseball\u2019s save stat came to be\nAngels\u2019 Andrew Heaney opens up about mental, emotional toll of injuries Pe\u00f1a started and allowed one run in 4-2/3 innings. It was an outing that showed both his promise and the hurdles he still needs to overcome.\nPe\u00f1a threw 40 sliders among his 90 pitches and the Rangers swung and missed at 11 of them, an excellent ratio. He struck out seven.\nHis issues, however, were command and control. He threw far too many pitches not even close enough to the strike zone to get hitters to think of swinging, which contributed to his two walks and his high pitch count.\nThe Angels also got key contributions from Brian Goodwin, who had a double to set up the first run and made a spectacular catch in left field. Calhoun drove in Goodwin with a single in the third.\n\u201cThat was a nice play against the wall,\u201d Ausmus said. \u201cThe double kind of started us off.

Another 19 were taken to hospitals, including two who were in critical condition.\nThe storm hit a month after devastating tornados hit neighbouring Alabama.\nA tornado was reported in the area 225km southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, at the time.\nNational Weather Service meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down on Saturday in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area. No injuries were reported there, but officials said several businesses and vehicles were damaged. Trees were down throughout the hilly city on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi.\nThe roof of a hotel in New Albany, Mississippi, was damaged, although the cause was unclear. Mississippi State University's 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado came near the school's campus in Starkville.\nUniversity spokesperson Sid Salter said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged. Trees were down and at least some minor damage was reported in residential areas east of the campus.\nHeavy rains and storms raked the Magnolia State into the night, then moved into Alabama. A possible tornado knocked out power and left damage in Troy, about 80km south of Montgomery. A mobile home community was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\nIn East Texas, two children were killed when a pine tree fell onto the back of the car in which they were riding in a severe thunderstorm Saturday.\nThe car was on a back country road in Pollok, Texas, about 240km southeast of Dallas. The tree \"flattened the car like a pancake,\" said Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff's Office. The children, ages 8 and 3, were dead at the scene, although both parents, who were in the front seat, escaped injury, he said.\nThe large storm system also knocked out power to thousands and caused flash floods. More than 140,000 customers lost power in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas as of late Saturday.\nA tornado hit the small Central Texas city of Franklin, overturning mobile homes and damaging other residences, said Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak. Franklin is about 200km south of Dallas.\nThe weather service said preliminary information showed an EF-3 tornado touched down with winds of 225 km/h. Crews were sent to survey the damage.\nTwo people were hospitalised for injuries not thought to be life-threatening, while others were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Yezak said. Some people had to be extricated from their homes.\nDowned trees and damage to buildings and a transmission tower were reported, said meteorologist Monique Sellers.\nWinds of up to 96 km/ h were reported in Cherokee County, Texas, damaging two homes in Alto, about 225km north of Houston, but no injuries were reported.\nThe forecast of severe weather forced officials at the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, to begin the tournament early on Sunday, starting threesomes off the first and 10th tees on the day's final round in hopes of finishing in midafternoon before the winds and rains begin.\n- AP\n", "domain": "radionz.co.nz", "title": "Deadly storms sweep across southern US states", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 27019, "url": "https://embed.radionz.co.nz/news/world/387068/deadly-storms-sweep-across-southern-us-states", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.13291007133154345}

The American Crime star faced a jury on April 16, the former TV producer\u2019s primary accuser, who was also called the \u201crapist,\u201d testified that Felicity hit on her in 1992, months after she alleged Jeffrey made the first \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d advances. Yet Felicity chose to take a stand in the courtroom! \u201cI was horrified, but I was also surprised,\u201d Felicity, who was flying out of the Bay Area for a family vacation, told Vanity Fair in a first-person piece on April 17. \u201cI could imagine not taking responsibility for something, but I just never thought I\u2019d be in this position.

That alone made it not worth it to fight.\u201d Although it\u2019s not uncommon for someone who is on trial to seek the defense of a friend or family member, Felicity still felt it was important for her to play the role of the accuser in the courtroom \u2014 even though she knew that it was no longer \u201cworth it\u201d to fight. \u201cI don\u2019t have a dysfunctional relationship with my husband.

{"article": "\u00d7 Uber Warns Investors About Upcoming Safety Report That Could Negatively Impact Brand\nUber\u2019s new chief of safety is warning investors that the company\u2019s safety report could have negative impacts on the brand.\nAs CNN reported Monday, Uber recently updated its corporate safety policy to include an \u201cintrusion report\u201d where employees should notify local law enforcement when they find out the identities of Uber drivers who have given rides to children under the age of 14.\nIn an email sent to Uber investors last month, Taylor Winston, Uber\u2019s chief of safety, said she is \u201cvery committed to creating a place where we have a positive reputation and where we could potentially change the perception of our brand.\u201d\nIn a follow-up email to CNN, Winston said Uber\u2019s reputation for violence against women has not been a recent concern. She referenced the 2015 Fortune profile of four women executives. According to the article, women make up less than one-third of Uber\u2019s board.\nRelated: Uber, Lyft decry increase in sexual assault of women at ride services\n\u201cThe point of our campaign wasn\u2019t to simply change any one aspect of our brand or marketing; it was to articulate a vision for safety,\u201d Winston said. \u201cThe rest of the world has been pointing out what we know about violence against women and how it applies to ridesharing. To us, that seemed very analogous to us trying to fix the conditions under which Uber operates.\u201d\nWinston told CNN that new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the safety campaign. It included messages from women at Uber about their experiences.\n\u201cOur last-mile transit partner\u2019s important role is not unique to Uber, but it happens across the transit sector and among female passengers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile he had heard about it before, he was immediately able to understand and address the underlying reasons for the perception.\u201d\nRelated: Silicon Valley\u2019s gun safety zeal costs lives\nUber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on this story.\nIn February, Uber posted a list of new safety features that could help it curb some of the violence. One of the proposed safety features is to use GPS to track users\u2019 location \u2014 including when a ride ends \u2014 and provide alerts when they approach a high-crime location.\nThe company also has 3,000 on-duty security, safety and crisis response staff around the world. On average, Uber has around 5,000 incident reports per day.\nThe company recently stepped up its reports. Last week, it began contacting the parents of the 500,000 riders that have given rides to minors on its platform since 2012.\nLast month, Uber posted a pledge titled \u201cHuman Trafficking: Lessons from Uber\u2019s 8 Years in Paris\u201d to mark the eight years it\u2019s been operating in Paris.\nThe company said it\u2019s committed to turning over every piece of information it has about sexual exploitation to the authorities.\n", "domain": "ktla.com", "title": "Uber Warns Investors About Upcoming Safety Report That Could Negatively Impact Brand", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Cnn Wire", "ind30k": 9392, "url": "https://ktla.com/2019/04/15/uber-warns-investors-about-upcoming-safety-report-that-could-negatively-impact-brand/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

After a long and dramatic first round, Hassan Aqeel of Siraj Golf Club proved that he belongs to the country's best golfers by breaking a record to shoot a one-under 71 on Day 2, securing a place in the semifinals. Fahad Ali of Mutafiz Travel Academy entered the semifinals with a sizzling 74, leaving Hassan Ali on the spot in the semifinal. Hassan Aqeel of Siraj was with a strong 73 after a two-under 70 on Day 1, but Fahad Ali grabbed the second place with a 73. Hassan Ali of Al Baraka with a two-under 70 in the first round followed by Hassan Aqeel of Siraj with a one-under 71 and Fahad Ali with a 73. Hammad Abbasi of Kashmir Golf and Country Club and Owais Ahmed of Royal Palm were vying for the 8th and 9th place respectively. Eighteen players including Khurram Nawaz and Muhammad Sohail of World Title Greens Inc had played the first round. Ten players from Turkey - Bulent Dahanoglu, Winancdar Bayrakci, Kerim Yapurli, Erol Fenta, Mehmet Aylenci, Fanay Tanlan, Seyla Turkgan, Muhammed Salahuddin, Rashid Sanjrani and Ahmet Ince - and Seven from Egypt - Constantine Itadyat, Abdel Kerim, Sami al-Boucheri, Ahmed Kadar, Assem Awad and Saeed Anis led the pack.\n\"This was a very long and challenging day for the top 30 players in the ranking. If you look at the standings the number of players who did not make it on the final round were few compared to those who made it. Quite interesting that some of the players in the qualifying rounds made really good starts and there were quite a few rounds in which the scores were even. So it was a difficult round for the players,\" remarked John Murphy, the tournament director.\nFrom Pakistan, Hassan Ali of Al Baraka is in the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa Cup, following his dramatic play in the earlier round, and Fahad Ali will be following the lead of Sohail Zaman and Owais Ahmed in qualifying for the UAE Golf Champions.\nAll the players will be relieved by the knowledge that they have an opportunity to make the event more meaningful for golf fans by making it a chance for them to find out who the favourite will be for the final against Fahad Ali of Mutafiz.\n", "domain": "nation.com.pk", "title": "Hassan wins Turkey trip for Turkish Airlines World Cup Golf", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Our Staff Report", "ind30k": 2564, "url": "https://nation.com.pk/17-Apr-2019/hassan-wins-turkey-trip-for-turkish-airlines-world-cup-golf", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "\u201cWhether you\u2019re writing for the mainstream media or not, it\u2019s all about amplification and content isn\u2019t enough if the media doesn\u2019t highlight it.\u201d\nBusiness Director at international PR agency, Logesign, Daniel Treach has spent the past 11 years helping clients develop their social cause campaigns and has a lot of useful and constructive advice to share with the marketing and PR industry.\nIn his new book, Unlocking the PR Power of Social Purpose, Daniel dives into the practicalities of social purpose, pointing out how PR, awareness, awareness, awareness and then amplification.\nNow more than ever, I believe, big brands need to consider social purpose as a core part of their marketing strategy.\nNumerous studies have confirmed that PR has a positive social impact.\nLinkedIn\u2019s PR Effectiveness Study says social media PR was more influential in creating awareness than any other social media form \u2013 increasing awareness by 62 per cent.\nThis is significant, considering over half of Aussie Aussies (55 per cent) and 47 per cent of Australians globally say they\u2019ve trusted public relations more than any other form of communication when it comes to making a decision.\nA strong social purpose campaign can create engagement and increased awareness at a low cost, which can then allow businesses to invest in more relevant, and more personal, messaging for consumers.\nDan adds, \u201cEvery major brand has social impact on their DNA; theirs is simply obscured by confusion. If you\u2019re taking the PR route in your marketing, don\u2019t be ashamed of the fact you\u2019re trying to make a social change.\n\u201cRather, embrace the idea that you\u2019re starting a movement with people. These initiatives create the space to make change and drive brand vibrancy.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t dictated by PR\u2019s overall purpose. It\u2019s a simple click of a button that affects the world. A social mission shouldn\u2019t only be focused on corporate social responsibility.\n\u201cThe practice can help define brand cause-led authenticity and that\u2019s why I wrote Unlocking the PR Power of Social Purpose.\u201d\nDan added, \u201cPeople get to a happy point of questioning what else they can do to make a difference in their community. In this difficult economic time, everyone wants to feel connected and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s work or work-life balance.\n\u201cSOCIAL PURPOSE is just as powerful as brand advocacy. From micro-nutritions of millions, to fostering and empowering local growth, SOCIAL PURPOSE has the potential to change the world.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy social influence, but if you have a great idea and understand how to execute your campaign with passion and creativity, consumers will find you.\n\u201cBrands are often scared to create campaigns that tell a social story in some way, but great brands will leverage that expertise to their advantage.\u201d\nFind more of Dan\u2019s great advice for your brand here.\n", "domain": "bandt.com.au", "title": "Why Your PR And Content Strategy Needs A Social Purpose", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "B T Magazine", "ind30k": 6278, "url": "http://www.bandt.com.au/media/pr-content-strategy-needs-social-purpose", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "The Federation of Palm Beach County's Premier Gala, one of the largest fundraising events in the South Florida Jewish community, recently was named in honor of the development community builder who has donated more than $1 million to the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County over the years.\nH. Irwin Levy donated the largest endowment gift in the Federation's history in December of 2013 with a $4 million gift for the Federation's public school program. Levy is a philanthropist and also Chairman and CEO of Goldberg Weiss Properties. He is the founder and past president of the board of directors of Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County. He was instrumental in the development of the Jewish Community School of Boca Raton. He also was one of the earliest private investors in and a major supporter of the Jewish Federation for a quarter of a century.\nIn addition to Levy, members of the Guild of the Federation who attended a reception last month at the Jewish Federation's offices in Boca Raton on Feb. 26 include trustees Elizabeth Meier, Blanche Wasserman, Lois Levine, Adele Liebman and Nora Prowsky as well as hospitality committee members Linder Seiler, Sue Frontero, Anne Estes,\nEllen Farrar, Sharon Thibeault and Yael Shragai.\nBoard of Trustees chairwoman Samir Patel, who organized the reception, said, \"We are all so proud of Mr. Levy's incredible generosity to the Federation.\"\nLillian Guerman, chairwoman of the Gala, also lauded Levy's generous support of the Jewish Federation.\n\"To be able to honor such a generous philanthropist is the best of what we do,\" Guerman said. \"We look forward to celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Gala and will continue to look for and seek out our next significant gift from Mr. Levy and his wonderful circle of philanthropic partners.\"\nPhyllis Singer, a Guild member who attended the reception, noted, \"Without Mr. Levy, we wouldn't have a Jewish Public School in our community, which is a phenomenal accomplishment. There was really nothing before it that we could brag about.\"\nPatel noted that many Guild members returned to the Gala for the first time since its inception as this was the 30th Anniversary Gala.\n\"We are fortunate to have so many great women to participate in this honor and to help plan and host the Gala on behalf of Mr. Levy,\" Patel said.\nThe Upper West Side New York-born Levy grew up in Russia. He came to the United States when he was 26. He started a real estate development company in 1967 and today has more than $5 billion in assets. Levy is the third generation in his family to work in the real estate industry.\nHe serves on the boards of the Jewish Federation of Greater Miami, Jewish National Fund in Brazil, Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in New York and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and chairs the board of the United Jewish Communities (UJC) of Greater Miami-Dade, which includes a real estate group with other members that is one of the largest real estate development groups in Latin America. He is the third-generation chair of his family's real estate development company.\nIn recent years, Levy has been the lead donor of several private contributions to the Federation. He raised more than $6 million for the Federation in 2013 and $3 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2015. He also created the Dr. Milton Feuerstein Scholar Award and is the primary donor of the Wilbur Levy Award for Excellence in Jewish Education. The Feuerstein and Levy awards were created to honor individuals who support and advance the Federation's educational, social and financial needs in Jewish life and in a community in which Jewish life in the USA is part of American culture.\nPatel noted, \"Mr. Levy has been the largest and one of the most valuable donors to the Federation and we thank him for his support.\"\nThe 2018 Premier Gala will take place on March 26 at the Palm Beach Renaissance in Wellington.\nFor more information about the Gala, go to www.jewishpbc.org.\n", "domain": "sun-sentinel.com", "title": "Jewish Federation of Palm Beach dinner named in honor of developer H.

Those profits will be made up of two main components: sales growth and gross margin improvement.\nThe retailer's stock has dipped this year because its sales are growing more slowly than the growth rate that management had originally forecast. That's a warning sign that Bed Bath & Beyond hasn't yet recaptured the levels of sales growth that customers are searching for. It also supports the argument that the retailer's real estate portfolio isn't long enough to meet demand, as CEO Steve Temares explained in a recent conference call with analysts.\n\"If you get a foot in the door, the sales conversion is stronger for those that stay in that business,\" he said. \"But if you go somewhere else and get a foot and then you leave, that business is softer.\"\nThe other concern, meanwhile, is that while Bed Bath & Beyond has managed to slash its cost of goods sold to help boost profits, that's at the expense of profitability. Gross margin is just 43.7% of sales, down from 44.3% a year ago. Management hopes to boost that metric back to 45% to give the business the boost it needs to manage higher sales growth and better results for its current customers.\n2. The sales recovery\nIn addition to sales growth, Bed Bath & Beyond will need to check in on its sales trends. Customer traffic is up as the retailer attracted more customers into its stores to buy a lot of things. The company is also trying to get shoppers to do a lot more browsing before buying. Bed Bath & Beyond has bulked up its assortment of kitchen and food items, which have higher profit margins, as well as its baby, bath, and home furnishings categories.\nManagement is particularly excited about these new areas. Chief Merchandising Officer Steven Temares said in an earnings conference call: \"With more customers exploring our assortment, we have experienced a gradual improvement in sales growth.\"\nThe store additions and merchandising changes are paying off. Comps increased 3% in Bed Bath & Beyond's last quarter, which was right in line with management's 2% target. That acceleration didn't happen by accident. The company spent $300 million more on store construction than planned through the first three quarters of the year.\n3. Keep the momentum going\nAll that said, management isn't worried about the slowing sales growth so far. And it doesn't sound like it will be a cause for sleepless nights for shareholders, either. CEO Steve Temares laid out Bed Bath & Beyond's expectations in a conference call to investors last month. \"We are pleased with our progress in many areas of the business, and we remain confident in our long-term goal of achieving mid-teens top-line growth and 20% earnings per share growth over the next five years,\" he said.\nExecutives are hoping that that kind of momentum continues to build this quarter. Bed Bath & Beyond's latest forecast calls for comps growth of 1% to 3% and a modest boost in earnings to $1.78 to $1.82 per share. But with the economic recovery strengthening and competition heating up, investors will want to look for proof that the retailer's improved customer service and technology investments are translating into better sales growth.\n", "domain": "fool.com", "title": "3 Things to Watch in Bed Bath & Beyond's Earnings Report -- The Motley Fool", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "Demitrios Kalogeropoulos, Demitri Covers Consumer Goods, As Well As Broader Moves In The Economy.", "ind30k": 9469, "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/09/3-things-to-watch-in-bed-bath-beyonds-earnings-rep.aspx", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Mary Berry's quick and easy Yorkshire puddings THE GREATEST YARN? Get some half eaten puddings while you wait for dinner Mary Berry and Pudsey know a thing or two about making puddings...\nWe all have some half eaten Yorkshire puddings lurking around at the back of the fridge - the ones you've left to call your own, but thought you didn't need them so kept them anyway. Nothing feels as indulgent as snuggling up with half eaten tea cakes in a bed of fresh blueberries or raspberries, while eagerly watching a cook show as your sweet tooth slowly but surely builds itself up to epic proportions. Still, if you're going to be holding onto these little gems forever, why not make the best ones?\nAnd by the sound of the Yorkshire pudding, some of the British pasty's greatest champions have been doing it right for years. Mary Berry explained to The BBC Radio 4, \"Some puddings take quite a bit of cooking. What I have done is make a simple sauce with minced beef and celery and sugar and orange and after I have cooked the ingredients, I have put them into a little buttered casserole dish, or into a bowl and covered it with foil and microwaved it, so they don't stick together. Then put them in the oven and let them cook for 10 minutes.\" Get one of these pan-fried puddings at M&S and give them a trial, with a tasty side salad of slightly sweet mixed salad leaves tossed with a fried onion, peanuts and crumbled feta.\nYorkshire puddings\nIngredients\n2 tbsp plain flour\n1-2 tbsp vegetable oil\n125g thinly sliced skinless, boneless beef mince\n1 onion, finely chopped\n750g russet potatoes, peeled and sliced\n300g fresh large blueberries or raspberries, fresh or frozen\n1 orange, peeled and sliced\n750g butternut squash, peeled and diced\n300g frozen mixed fruit, cut into chunks\n400g jar custard cream\n300g fresh white breadcrumbs\n2 tbsp golden caster sugar\nTo serve\nFritters\nFrozen sliced blueberries\nMETHOD\nMix the flour with the soy sauce and oil, then stir in the minced beef.\nAdd the onion and fry for 3 minutes, until the onion is soft. Add the potatoes and red-wine to the pan and simmer until the potatoes are soft and cooked through, about 30 minutes.\nAdd the blueberries, orange and chopped pumpkin. Stir well, pour in the butternut squash and 2 cups of boiling water and simmer for 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the custard cream and 50ml water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes, until thickened and pudding-like.

{"article": "By Malik Shabazz\nAllowing undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's license is not a \"privilege,\" but a matter of common sense. From speeding to drunken driving, crashes claimed more than 9,000 lives in New Jersey in 2016, and nearly half of those were caused by an immigrant driving without a license. The New Jersey resident who created \"Ask a Driver\" in 1968 at the Princeton University campus offices was a leader in the effort to make roads safer for all New Jerseyans.\n\"Every once in a while, someone will drive by and say, 'Oh, what about the people who are here illegally?' But if you are here legally, you should have the same freedoms as all other citizens. You should be able to own a home, drive a car, have a job, and enjoy the same opportunities as other citizens in this country,\" said William Johnson, professor emeritus of English at Princeton University.\nBut immigrants without a license are often denied access to services such as medical care, welfare and basic community services. Immigrants without a license are ineligible for roughly 58 state agencies, including municipal unemployment, welfare and child welfare services, which require state-issued driver's licenses.\nThis means that many immigrants are forced to drive with licenses that are not valid in New Jersey or are suspended without a valid reason, opening them up to citations and making them targets for crime.\nPassing driver's exam is required of every applicant for a New Jersey driver's license, regardless of immigration status. Now that the U.S. Department of Justice has told states that immigrants who are in the country illegally must be eligible for driver's licenses, the state should take note of the \"Ask a Driver\" program.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at the Georgetown University Law Center is monitoring the state's implementation of the Trump administration's guidelines on the issuance of driver's licenses to immigrants. The clinic is also urging the state to issue driver's licenses for non-citizens who provide documentation such as marriage licenses and green cards, as well as the receipt of survivor benefits.\n\"We are starting in southern and central New Jersey where the overwhelming majority of our residents live. The focus will be on those areas where the pace of liberalization is slower. We're advocating for 1,000 drivers to get driver's licenses, and for the state to seek partnerships with not-for-profit community groups to distribute licenses where they can afford to go, or where they don't have the capacity to provide themselves,\" said Matthew Marrero, assistant director at the clinic.\nThe Latino coalition of the New Jersey Troopers Association wrote to New Jersey's Department of Motor Vehicles in March saying that it's \"increasingly difficult for law enforcement to enforce safety laws by properly enforcing existing state law in the absence of enforcement of federal immigration law.\" The letter said that there are drivers with a criminal record who are able to obtain licenses, and therefore there is a \"grave concern for law enforcement regarding the safety of the public and its members.\"\nDOT will be asked to open a new public comment period on the program, which will be available to New Jersey residents until June 6.\nFederal law requires the state to follow federal regulations for issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and illegal immigrants. But in a recent meeting, the New Jersey State Association of Counties executive director said that the department's stance is that the licenses are \"not issued as documents or permits, they are driver's licenses. It's not only about driving safety, but also access to the state services.\"\nDonald Rhee, director of the Department of Public Safety's Administration Division, maintains that the department is doing its best to prevent confusion between the state's intentions with a driver's license and federal immigration policies.\n\"There has been no change in department policy or the current process of issuing driver's licenses or non-driver IDs to non-citizens in New Jersey,\" Rhee said. \"A year after the legal framework for issuing driver's licenses to aliens was finalized, our nation is experiencing a political disagreement that has caused some to consider the legal status of immigrants. The perception that the New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles is \"suspending\" immigrant driver's licenses can only reflect a lack of understanding of our law, particularly as it relates to non-U.S. citizens.\"\nNew Jersey immigrants can drive legally -- but only if they've done the right thing first.\nMalik Shabazz is executive director of DAPAProject.org and a field organizer with the New Jersey Immigrant Rights Alliance.\nBookmark NJ.com/Opinion.

{"article": "Bangladesh stands fifth in the list of the world's growing economies, up two places in the 2018 World Development Indicators report released yesterday.\n\u201cWhile agriculture and the informal sector are still predominant in Bangladesh, the informal sector is rapidly shrinking and has higher levels of activity than the agricultural sector,\u201d said the World Bank in the report.\nThe total value of the informal sector is about 39 percent of the GDP in 2016 and a share of more than 40 percent in 2016 and 2017 in Kenya, the report said.\n\u201cStrong economy, rural poor among poorest\u201d will remain key challenges for Bangladesh.\nAccording to the report, a 4 percent growth rate would mean that one-third of the population in Bangladesh would be living on less than $1.90 a day in 2025.\nThe growth rate for 2019 in Bangladesh, which is already slowing down, is 1.7 percent, noted the WB.\nSitting in the middle of the list at 31st, the report said Bangladesh ranked better than some of its South Asian neighbours and near the front of countries growing faster than China.\nAt 2.7 percent, the country's growth is projected to be among the lowest globally, said the World Bank.\nBangladesh, which was among the top 50 fastest growing economies at 8.8 percent rate, was among the top 25 emerging countries, which has good demographics, infrastructure and growth potential, said the report.\nHowever, three things will be needed to push it up \u2013 firm commitments for the trade agreement which will define growth momentum for the coming decades, finance for infrastructure, and improved governance.\n\u201cGlobalisation and a strong financial system will be key factors driving the pace of change in Bangladesh's economy.\u201d\n\u201cFast growth requires that the government ensures inclusive growth and development,\u201d said Kaushik Basu, the WB's chief economist, who launched the report at the Jawaharlal Nehru Exhibition Centre.\n\u201cGrowth of the economy is defined by increasing productivity and real income. Although the growth has been strong over the last 20 years, not enough income has been received by a large proportion of the population,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat, I would argue, is the biggest challenge for Bangladesh.\u201d\nDhaka is able to sustain a higher growth trajectory because it has completed infrastructure development, Basu noted.\n\u201cBut having those good things, not putting the middle-class in jobs, and creating a society where people are healthy and happy in their jobs will all be important to maintain the pace of growth.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not to say there aren't challenges. If we look at the ability of a Bangladesh to produce goods for which it is cheap, the manufacturing is a competitive advantage, but when it comes to human beings, skill and education, a huge and damaging disadvantage looms.\u201d\n\u201cSo, solving the challenge is crucial.\u201d\nThe report noted that Bangladesh's infrastructure gaps have led to a reliance on imports, and then their transport and storage. The trade deficit increased from $3.4 billion in 2005 to $29.4 billion in 2015.\nOf the total imports, $10.8 billion are by the informal sector, the WB said. In addition, the import growth is slowing down to four percent, and even below four percent in some sectors.\nFiscal policies must address the gaps, the WB urged.\nThe World Bank called for a larger inflow of foreign capital from abroad and the implementation of the trade agreement.\nGovernment's new growth strategy, taking into account the potential of rural areas, should provide an escape valve to medium-term growth, the bank said.\nThis will require some reorientation of policies towards rural development, especially in financial inclusion.\nIt also noted that FDI should be targeted towards growth areas with high quality infrastructure and innovation.\nIn the report, the WB also noted that most regions in the country were poor, with only urban areas sustaining a sub-Saharan African growth rate above five percent.\n", "domain": "thedailystar.net", "title": "Bangladesh in top 5 growing economy: WB", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 2523, "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/world/news/bangladesh-top-5-growing-economy-wb-1724815", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

It could be trafficking, it could be corruption, it could be fights. The narrative is always the same.\nYoung people, with time and social problems, cannot find a suitable job, can not find some stability and they want to try new things. So when they turn to us, we try to respond to them.\nWe started thinking about this notion of making a book that could open the door to a dialogue between Africans and the French abroad. The book is a volume of poems that relate to the story of Michel Mamberti, an African and the director of the French Language Centre in Paris, and to the youngsters who come to the centre.\nImage copyright FAIMA Image caption The book is a collection of poems\nIn their poems we see that the youths want to belong, and they feel French and African at the same time. Through this poem, we invited their teachers in France to co-publish. Each verse is an answer to a question or an emotional side of the narrative of these youths.\nSo, today, we are opening the doors of our library in Paris to the youths in Kampala. The book is a collection of poems, and we are taking the one that is more French to the youths to their countries where the French is not so strong.\nMany of the youths, especially in these countries where the French is not as strong, there is a project called \"Back to the future\". So we will send a bus with a mobile library on the road to the youths' countries, where we will try to be a bridge, to open the doors to the French language and the French culture.\nImage copyright FAIMA Image caption Dr Michel helped to organise the book launch in Kampala\nThese projects started with the news about the advent of Macron. Everybody was quite surprised because, even in Germany, Macron has a majority, but in the African countries, we didn't have a leader with such popularity. This was a huge surprise.\nWe have been waiting for the left-right debate, but it has not happened. And we have to be careful not to be seduced by the political soapbox.

{"article": "KARACHI: A plan for the restoration of the historic Frere Hall, which is soon to be restored under the Frere Heritage Complex Development Plan, was released at a ceremony in the auditorium of the landmark on Saturday.\nMr Hamidul Haq and Mr Shahid Nadeem Khokhar, the chairperson and the managing director of the National Assembly\u2019s Textile and Textile Processing Industries Development Authority (TPIDA), respectively, along with the vice chairman of the Frere Hall\u2019s Conservancy and the conservancy\u2019s executive director, were present.\nThe ceremony was attended by Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, Minister for Economic Affairs Miftah Ismail, Habib Raza Siddiqui, former minister for culture and tourism Saeed Ghani, Chairperson of Sindh Tourism Development Corporation Sajida Tabbasum, Members of the Sindh Assembly Dr Samar Mubarak Mandokhail and Haleem Adil Shaikh, Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar, Sindh Legislative Assembly Members Dr Sagheer Ahmed and Abdul Sattar Thahir, and members of local trade associations.\nIt was, however, the detailed presentation by CPLC director Fazal Ullah Jan, one of the representatives of the CPLC, who garnered attention. With beautiful hand-drawings on the giant wooden board that sat on the stage, he painted the grounds around the venue, much like a walking tour. According to the overall plan, the rooms of the Frere Hall would be divided into five zones: lobby, hall, library, ladies\u2019 gallery and garden.\nThe main stage at the front of the hall would be built near the park around which the room is located. On the other side, one of the rare sections of the garden would be added as a heritage zone to the courtyard of the hall and one of the gardens where the stall owners would display their wares would be added.\nAdditionally, special rooms would be built that could be converted into meeting rooms or air-conditioned ones. The 60-year-old theatre would also be restored as a performing arts centre.\nIn total, there would be five screen theatres for use by the different schools, colleges and universities, four for use by the private sector and one for public gatherings. The remaining 1,240 kanals of land within the premises would be utilised for other uses such as classrooms, recreational and public meeting areas, sports and agricultural gardens.\nOne of the things that caught the attention of almost everyone present was a signboard on the back of a book, which shows a map of the city. This reminder makes the place seem as if it is part of the very city it belongs to, which is indeed what makes it special. The signboard\u2019s design symbolises this.\nA further detail on the plan is what is perhaps the plan\u2019s most compelling feature \u2014 the structure of Frere Hall \u2014 is being preserved in its original state. The hall is adorned with 15th century painted and covered woodwork decorations, an original, in fact, in Karachi\u2019s history.\nThe plan calls for a sound system to be installed in the hall as well as throughout the complex. But the building\u2019s wooden walls are its most significant feature as it provides a stark reminder of its heritage value.\nThe project would be implemented in five phases over five years beginning with the first phase, which will run from next March to end of March 2024. The second phase of the project will start next year, which will be done in three years\u2019 time, 2018-2021. The third phase is proposed to be completed in 2021-2023 and the fourth phase will commence the following year.\nBefore presenting the plan, Mr Haq said the interior of the hall would be renovated and electrical connections would be installed. But the most basic work, he said, would be a complete re-decoration of the original furniture and decorations to be installed in the rooms, gardens and grounds. And, very importantly, he said, a lighting system would be built in all the rooms, halls and gardens.\nSindh Parks Authority MD Azeem Hassan Rathore said that with the creation of the park around the hall, so many new visitors would be attracted and revenue earned would also increase in huge quantities. \u201cThe cost of the first phase of the project is estimated at Rs836 million,\u201d he said.\nNaeem Memon, the conservancy\u2019s executive director, said that the project would be implemented in phases, starting with 2018-19, which would cost Rs290 million. The second phase, he said, would be completed in 2021-2022, costing Rs746 million, and the third", "domain": "dawn.com", "title": "Plans unveiled for Frere Hall restoration", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Peerzada Salman, Chris Roberts, Mumtaz Ahmed Shah, Aquila Ismail, Very Angry.", "ind30k": 6643, "url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1475896/plans-unveiled-for-frere-hall-restoration", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Many mobile games have tried to create augmented reality content for Android phones. When Pok\u00e9mon Go was released last year, it changed the industry by causing players to switch from their phones to their wearable devices. (Pok\u00e9mon Go was not designed with the Google Glass, and the Google Glass hasn\u2019t been released in the U.S. yet.) Pok\u00e9mon Go has also served as an example of how other kinds of AR experiences are currently lacking in quality and functionality.\nPok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s success did take some of the heat off AR, but not for all games. Dash, which is another Google Glass app (and is also available for a smartphone), is actually experiencing difficulty even though it was one of the first games built for Glass. Earlier this year, when the Guardian reviewed Pocket AR, the flagship app that Google introduced back in 2015, they noted: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else like it, and certainly no phone games of the same quality.\u201d\nIf anyone needed an example of the kinds of problems we have yet to solve, seeing how games like Super Mario Run handled their live AR experiences was the perfect treat. As Time puts it, \u201cSuper Mario Run didn\u2019t have to stop and consult with a map after you moved from one viewpoint to another. It didn\u2019t need to tell you that you were in front of a grassy landscape. It didn\u2019t need to encourage you to pay attention to the direction in which you were actually moving by mimicking the eyes\u2019 position on your screen.\u201d As a result, the game functioned like a much more natural, satisfying, and immersive experience than Pokemon Go, which required players to dive into a solitary experience.\nA view from two teams\nPok\u00e9mon Go was a radical departure from the norm of the AR space. Usually, games include a dedicated location marker so that players know where they are in the real world. But for Super Mario Run, Niantic also added AR gameplay features using their proprietary camera tech for a fully immersive AR experience. They knew they were probably going to change the landscape of mobile AR with that product, and while it\u2019s been successful, it does create a problem for both consumers and developers.\nBy changing the game\u2019s graphics to take into account how far away a player is, for example, it means that every time a player walks two or three feet, they might be placed in an area that makes for a more difficult experience than it would be in a static game. Traditional smartphone games would need to plan out in such a way that your position on the screen should exactly mirror your location in the real world. As a result, in-game updates would be more difficult to pull off for AR.\nWhile we still have a lot of work to do before augmented reality becomes ubiquitous, especially since there is still no Glass-ready AR camera and few of the Android phones that did come out have the built-in camera that the current Niantic camera has, the company is still working on how they can improve the experience.\nUsing its own drone\nAfter looking at an early prototype of the AR camera, Niantic CEO John Hanke told me that one of their immediate goals was to figure out a way to build the system into a drone. That way, a game developer could shoot 3D footage of their game, then send it to Niantic for their AR camera to try and combine those images and turn them into interactive AR content.\nIn the future, this will have a more obvious connection to Nintendo\u2019s new AR glasses that haven\u2019t yet been announced. With Nintendo\u2019s AR glasses set to finally be out in a couple of years, the company might find that all their content and gameplay experiences are just a virtual reality headset away.\nThe AR map seen in Pok\u00e9mon Go and the Niantic AR camera \u2014 both shown in Super Mario Run \u2014 are only the start of the company\u2019s efforts.\nThe reader comments at the Pok\u00e9mon Go launch event in 2016 indicate how well-received Niantic\u2019s AR tech has been. One commenter said: \u201cYou\u2019ve solved a problem that no one\u2019s thinking about. Augmented reality + live video + citizens reporting = a new future for Pok\u00e9mon as a multi-platform content library where it used to be solely on the Nintendo 3DS.\u201d\nMaybe that future has already arrived.\nGiancarlo Valdes is the program director of market insights at Unity Technologies.

{"article": "CLIFTON, N.J. -- It was a rare packed house for a weeknight in the suburbs and when the movie was over the sold-out crowd of about 100 on April 3 spilled haltingly into the light.\nA few -- a gaggle of nuns in their habits, at least one collared priest -- wore their dispositions on their sleeves. Others communicated in muted gestures, dabbed at tears, or lingered for long stretches in the popcorn-strewn vestibule at the AMC multiplex here, as if still processing the deliberately provocative movie they had just seen.\nSince March 29, similar scenes have played out across the country as faith-based groups and many others have gathered en masse to see Unplanned, a new movie that paints a scathing portrait of abortion rights in general and Planned Parenthood in particular.\nMolly Livingstone, a social media marketer in Dallas, organized about 170 people from her church to attend an early screening of the movie. It so struck her, she said, that she was moved to volunteer for an anti-abortion pregnancy center.\nFELT COMPELLED\nIn Davenport, Iowa, the St. Thomas Aquinas Guild of the Quad Cities, an anti-abortion medical organization, raised $4,000 to buy tickets for members and civic leaders. Maggie Schoonmaker, a fertility educator who was involved in the effort, said she felt compelled to spread the word about the film.\n\"The movie provides a way for people to learn the truth about abortion and reproductive rights outside of a church,\" she said.\nUnplanned has banked on its ability to draw such motivated crowds, despite what the filmmakers -- Christian anti-abortion advocates hoping to make a dent in Hollywood -- described in interviews as a torrent of adversity.\nFirst, they said, came the denial letters from companies holding the rights to songs they had hoped to include on the film's soundtrack. Then it was an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, normally a kiss of death in evangelical, Mormon and other religious communities.\nTelevision networks, too, rejected the film's trailer as too political to touch. The official Unplanned Twitter account, erroneously linked to online trolls, was temporarily suspended on opening weekend and the star of the movie, Ashley Bratcher, has struggled to book TV interviews outside Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network.\nOf course, no film is entitled to media exposure. And in each of the above cases, the companies and networks denied singling out Unplanned. But the belief among anti-abortion communities that powerful forces have arrayed against the film has kindled long-smoldering claims of liberal and anti-religious bias in the media and Silicon Valley. And it has animated high-profile conservatives -- including Vice President Mike Pence; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Donald Trump Jr. -- who have risen to the movie's defense, seeking to turn it into the latest battlefront of the culture wars.\nFor now, writer-directors Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon can console themselves with a hit. Unplanned exceeded box-office expectations on its opening weekend, earning more than $6 million -- and recouping its budget -- from just 1,100 screens. It expanded that figure this weekend, earning $3.2 million after spreading to 500 more theaters.\nThe movie comes as conservatives are feeling emboldened to roll back abortion rights, including potentially overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, after the confirmation in October of Justice Brett Kavanaugh solidified their majority on the Supreme Court. Another anti-abortion film, Roe v. Wade, starring conservative actor Jon Voight, was promoted at the annual March for Life rally in Washington in January, but has yet to announce a distribution partner or release date.\nSolomon said he hoped the film would help trigger \"the cultural moment that overturns Roe v. Wade.\"\n\"That would absolutely be a victory for us,\" he added.\nOTHER FAITH-BASED FILMS\nThe success of Unplanned follows that of other faith-based films, such as last year's I Can Only Imagine and an earlier Konzelman and Solomon effort, God's Not Dead, which have demonstrated the box-office power of a passionate demographic that often says it is overlooked, if not persecuted, by left-leaning Hollywood.\nThe filmmakers said they want the same treatment as that given to films favored by the abortion-rights movement, such as RBG, the documentary about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Konzelman also referenced an announced film that will star Sandra Bullock as former Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, who has campaigned against restrictions on abortion rights.\n\"Would any of the places that turned us down for advertising turn down Sony, or Paramount, or Universal with a Sandra Bullock movie from the other side?\" he asked. \"I dare say not.\"\nUnplanned is based on the memoir of the same name by Abby Johnson, a former director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan, Texas, who became a celebrity of the anti-abortion movement after what she said was a crisis of conscience. The film dramatizes her conversion narrative and includes three unflinching portrayals of abortions, the first and most explicit of which occurs in the first 10 minutes. (Reports in Texas Monthly and Salon have raised questions about the details of Johnson's story, and Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the movie adaptation \"promotes many falsehoods.\")\nEARNED AN R RATING\nThe abortion scenes earned the movie its R rating, for \"some disturbing/bloody images,\" which meant that its trailers could not run in front of non-R-rated films, or even on some Christian radio stations, such as K-Love and Air1. But the filmmakers said they were not willing to compromise on the graphic portrayals, which are central to the film's appeal to viewers as a self-proclaimed expos\u00e9 that promises hard truths.\nIn that first scene, teased in the trailer and on posters as \"the moment that changed everything,\" Abby, played by Bratcher, witnesses an ultrasound-guided termination of a pregnancy at 13 weeks. The ultrasound, as depicted on screen, shows a fetus with a discernible head, torso and limbs frantically squirming away from a doctor's probe -- an action that Abby later describes as \"twisting and fighting for its life\" -- before being liquefied by suction.\nGiven a description of this scene, Jennifer Villavicencio, a fellow with the nonpartisan American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who performs ultrasound-guided abortions but has not seen the film, said that while an ultrasound of a 13-week-old fetus may show a visible head and body, the notion that it would be \"fighting for its life\" is misleading.\n\"If you watch an ultrasound, certainly there is movement, but it's not kicking its legs or recoiling,\" Villavicencio said. She noted broad scientific consensus that fetuses cannot experience pain and therefore would not recoil from it until well after 13 weeks.\n\"There is no neurological capability for awareness of danger -- that part of the brain is simply not there yet,\" she said.\nKonzelman and Solomon defended the scene as faithful to Johnson's personal account and said it had been vetted by Anthony Levatino, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist and longtime anti-abortion activist, who also plays the doctor in the scene.\nUltimately, Unplanned may not need scientific consensus to be effective with its most critical base of support. At the sold-out AMC theater in New Jersey, several attendees, who identified as being against abortion rights, said they were moved by a film that addressed what they said was the deeper truth of a subject few are willing to face head on.\n\"This movie tells the truth and a lot of times we don't get an opportunity to see that,\" said Cheryl A. Riley, director of the Respect Life office for the Archdiocese of Newark, who organized the viewing and works with women who have had abortions.\nDescribing herself, like Johnson, as formerly in favor of abortion rights, Riley choked up while recalling her own experience terminating a pregnancy at 19: \"I know that story and I know that pain.\"\nMovieStyle on 04/12/2019\n", "domain": "arkansasonline.com", "title": "Anti-abortionists go Hollywood", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Reggie Ugwu The New York Times", "ind30k": 1777, "url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/apr/12/anti-abortionists-go-hollywood-20190412/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.15083367498529926}
{"article": "FOR SOLID years the Albert Hill and Broomhill mortuary near Darlington was a prominent and respected part of the East Durham landscape.\nAccording to local historian Michael Wight, the mortuary, which was at its best in the 1850s and 1860s, held the dead and the living, with the most chilling duty of all \u2013 the mummification of dead Irishmen who had been brutally tortured in Cork, shot at Dublin, and who returned to the UK by boat just before the civil war.\nHe says: \u201cThe Irish authorities on the Titanic Committee would have had nothing to do with their mummification, which was a private affair. There were many tippling Irishmen in the community who found the idea of tampering with bodies quite attractive, because their removal from the fishmongers and dairy shops would be painful.\u201d\nThe bodies were kept in a dark room with a trough with plenty of ale for the mummified bodies, and when people asked to see them, the mortuary staff would ask why, and they would often answer \u201cThere\u2019s some of my ancestors up there.\u201d These were proudly displayed and visited by members of the Irish community who also mingled and drank with them.\nWhen The Northern Echo reported on the mummification of the 49th Battalion Irishman, Henry Briggs from the Diocese of Durham, in 1894, we quoted Jim Campbell, from Darlington: \u201cIt is my statement to you as a Catholic man that this is the highest manner of the offering that a Catholic can make to God.\u201d\nIn 1891, The Northern Echo reported that 25 bodies had been dug up on the Albert Hill Estate, and it continued: \u201cA number of men working in the garden at the roadside are said to have been caught by a young man from Ireland named Frank, who was later taken in by local women. Frank has said that he was paid a certain amount of money and afterwards told the women, \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u2019\u201d\nIt is quite possible that there were more people involved in the Albert Hill affair than five people, so the mystery of what happened to the bodies is as vexed as ever. When The Northern Echo wrote in November 1929, its first mention of the case, it said there was little work for general surgeons, but the pyschological work on people \u201cis generally kept very busy, as is the removal of bodies after mummification.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cThe place of mummification is just beyond Mr Redmond\u2019s near-by kipper. The Irish suffer all the more when pressed upon by necessity.\u201d\nOn September 13, 1971, another The Northern Echo correspondent reported that there were no-one alive to claim the bodies of their ancestors who might be buried at the spot they fell through the air, and he quoted a woman saying: \u201cMummy, mummy \u2013 what did you do it?\u201d\nMummy, maybe!\nTO THE grave\nREMEMBER former Darlington mayor Elizabeth Carter, who died suddenly aged 64 in March 1957?\nShe fought to keep open the blacksmiths\u2019 yard at Seaton Cres, where early 19th century blacksmiths still produce stone plaques for local cemeteries. When Mrs Carter and her Labour councillors died, Mr Anthony Lloyd, the blacksmiths\u2019 foreman, said: \u201cMiss Carter supported me all the way; my name has been hanged in her honour.\u201d\nIt was a stormy period in Darlington at the time, and the cemeteries and yesteryear-abandoned buildings in Seaton Cres were a magnet for rowdy and drunken drinkers.\nMr Lloyd and the remaining foreman, Stanley Friar, fought to keep the yards open to maintain the style of old Darlington \u2013 great with mules and sometimes the infamous blacksmiths \u2013 but councillors did not want anyone to get hurt, and in September 1957 a council meeting was told that all the foreman\u2019s workers must leave the yard.\nIt was decided, wrongly as it turned out, that the yard would become a retail centre and develop into a former fire station.\nGood on Councillor Lloyd for sticking to his guns and fighting to keep old Darlington preserved and true to the best of the past, and a very sad goodbye for Elizabeth Carter, as she will be buried in Seaton Cres.\nBy the way, Mrs Carter was Darlington\u2019s youngest mayor. She was elected mayor of Darlington at the age of 34 in 1903, becoming one of the youngest mayors in the world at the time.\n", "domain": "thenorthernecho.co.uk", "title": "A shadowy figure in the Irish community was beaten to death on Albert Hill - was it by his own men or the police?", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 1777, "url": "https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/17570608.a-shadowy-figure-in-the-irish-community-was-beaten-to-death-on-albert-hill-was-it-by-his-own-men-or-the-police/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "TEHRAN \u2014 Bagh-e Narenjestan is a famous hot spring located in Shahidsaran district, south of Shiraz.\nLocated 15 kilometers from Shiraz city limits, Bagh-e Narenjestan is naturally formed by ancient hot springs.\nSoaked water flows from cool cracks in the rocks of the spring, which is also a source of seasonal flood, according to Shiraz National Heritage and Tourism Organization.\nA 1,500-meter long, 23-meter wide and 1-meter deep natural spring, Bagh-e Narenjestan has several springs whose water is naturally filtered through porous sand and clay rock. The freshest springs to visit contain a slight smell of bergamot, Farsi lemon or sugar snap pea.\nThe hot springs have attracted tourists and hikers for centuries, and an entrance fee of 6,000 rials (nearly $175) is imposed to access the waterfall. The spring draws a lot of tourists from Persian Gulf countries and southeastern Asia.\nThe spring is surrounded by a picturesque site of Shafqat mountain and its natural surroundings, perfect for relaxation. The mountain is surrounded by semi-arid flora and fauna and its surrounding rock also contains rare species of plants.\nMost recently the cliff sides of Shafqat mountain were cracked by earthquakes and subsequently covered by the some warm spring water. It is the first time such type of phenomenon occurred in our country.\nBagh-e Narenjestan in Shiraz\nThe river Bagh-e Narenjestan starts in the foothills of Shafqat Mountain, which is close to the mountain like a canyon. The spring waters infiltrate and infiltrate into the rocky canyon and then become connected to the river.\nThe river flows through the gorge filled with billowing fog and rolling snow over the ravines. As the spring waters become colder during the winter, the trail trail is covered with snow. Over the winter the river becomes covered with at least 4 meters of snow.\nBuilt by Farahani for Eid al-Adha, the earliest known pavilion of Shiraz, Bagh-e Narenjestan was built in 1580 to mark the beginning of the Islamic Holy Month of Ramadan. It is related to the 4th century B.C. Shahian al-Narenjeen (between Lahijan al-Managing Inferior) who built the most famous Shiraz date fort.\nThe waterfall connects to the upper part of the Shiraz Old Port, which has 40,000 square meters of limestone quarrying area.

{"article": "I\u2019m not a pro gardener, but it dawned on me as I rolled my London Plane Belvedere specimen planter bed that it\u2019s an approach that works for making significant garden changes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to go out of your way to find something unique that expresses your garden style,\u201d says Beth in her public-speaking therapy class. It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it\u2019s also good advice. And yet even with all the advancements made by gardeners in the last century, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve made enough room for one of the most important aspects of our environment. It\u2019s the space we put flowers in, especially in containers. Many good things come out of it, too.\nOn a simple level, I\u2019m talking about garden biodiversity. Edible plants flourish, creating a cleaner environment. They attract pollinators and start a healthy cycle in the greenhouse. Ultimately, they make us happy. They use up resources that are far too valuable to waste and the basics are really affordable \u2014 just get some good containers.\nMy Belvedere plant was some sort of ornamental stone that had been selected for its resemblance to a London plane. It was about seven feet high with three (or four if you prefer) long stems of red foliage and silver cap plantation. Its name was a codex: A small, ancient plant thought to have belonged to the tribe of the speaker of the seven ancient languages.\nI turned the planter upside down, put the pot in a sunny window so that daylight flooded in and pressed it to a consistent level of soil. That slight variance in elevation combined with the internal temperature of the heavy pot caused problems. The pot was leaking because of the soil\u2019s slow release, and the pressure acted like a hammock to push soil airiness around. Blooms began to wilting.\nHaving failed to break through to the pot\u2019s natural structure, I tried something different. I added a few inches of root ball concrete, and slightly raised the tip of the plant\u2019s stem using a sheet of wood tied off in the left-hand corner of the pot. Now, the liquid soil I\u2019d been pumping through the pot had redirected its centre of gravity so that its center mass felt loose and less bound together. With the raised plant stem, the plant moved and expanded in relation to the pot, feeling more airy in a way that the clumsy, inefficient plant design had not.\nThe additional soil weight in the pot was just right to promote greater movement in the soil and induce greater airy growth. I varied the plant height as needed, using a thin, broom-like, foldable screen. This reduced the accumulation of salt and eliminated the need for draining when the plant was less than 10 cm tall, and therefore needed no drainage from the soil.\nThe only other improvement was a branched out arch of carefully selected granite followed by some soil infused with agave. The large, lime-filtered agave not only provides a very attractive look and would allow water to better cross the root barrier, it also serves as a means of attracting pollinators and started a chain reaction that created an entirely new garden.\nI have many outdoor containers \u2014 perhaps as many as 12 \u2014 and if they ever could be balanced against a garden wall, I don\u2019t see why my plants could not find a balance, too. If anything, I\u2019d like to see more gardeners take an approach like this \u2014 and get into the most creative mixing of materials, growing and density that they can think of. If your garden is often lost in the shuffle, perhaps you should put some plants in containers, too.\nBRIAN MINTER is a Toronto-based landscape designer.

{"article": "Dear Amy: I have a 6-year-old granddaughter. She is pretty, kind, smart, helpful and active with many friends. She has always been a picky eater. She eats very little protein, hardly any vegetables, some fruit, nuts and peanut butter, but does consume dairy and lots of salty snacks, breads, cookies, sweets, \u201chealth\u201d bars, etc.\nHer parents have tried to get her to eat more nutritious foods, but they continually give in with the sweet and salty items because they want her to eat something. They also often buy her sweets. She is noticeably heavier than others her age.\nI\u2019ve made a few light suggestions, but I\u2019m no expert. I don\u2019t want to make them feel they\u2019re being bad parents. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve asked their pediatrician.\nI worry about obesity, diabetes, kids making fun of her, and other results of being overweight. Do you have any suggestions? Can you give me the words for talking to the parents, and offer some helpful advice?\n\u2014 Nana\nDear Nana: Your granddaughter is at the perfect age to learn about healthy nutrition. Learning about nutrition can be as simple as playing a game in the supermarket, learning to read labels, and choosing \u201cwhole\u201d foods over processed foods. You can do this with her. Tell her to find some of her favorite foods and see if you can replace some of the processed foods with an equivalent product but with fewer ingredients. Don\u2019t force her to eat meat (dairy, nuts, eggs and veggies provide protein).\nThe very best way for children to learn about nutrition is to cook!\nGrandchildren have been cooking with their \u201cNanas\u201d since the dawn of time.\n\u201cCooking\u201d can be cutting up fruit and veggies and arranging the pieces into a fun-looking salad.\nCooking can be measuring the appropriate proportions of rice to water for the rice cooker, making healthy smoothies or stirring easy-to-make caramel sauce to dip apple slices into. She can even make her own \u201chealth\u201d bars.\nYou should not tell your granddaughter that she is fat, or will be fat, or that she is \u201cchunky,\u201d \u201chusky,\u201d \u201cbig boned,\u201d or any iteration of this. You should not comment on the size or shape of her body. You should only focus on positive, healthy choices, and choose activities \u2014 both in and out of the kitchen \u2014 that help her to feel awesome, strong, and in control.\nLet your granddaughter take some of these healthy lessons back to her parents. There are dozens of fun cookbooks geared toward kids. My pal Mollie Katzen has authored several.

{"article": "Republican Gov. Mike DeWine scored a big policy victory with last week\u2019s passage of a 2019-20 highway budget that\u2019ll boost road-building and repairs. Ohio\u2019s gas tax, now 28 cents a gallon, will rise to 38.5 cents, and diesel fuel, also now 28 cents a gallon, to 47 cents. (FYI, the Ohio Constitution says gas-tax money may only be used for to build or fix roads or to fund the State Highway Patrol.)\nThe Legislative Service Commission reports the tax hike will produce an additional $865 million in each of the next two years. That\u2019s roughly 70 percent of what DeWine requested, but significantly more than some counterproposals. Senate Republicans, for example, initially wanted to provide only an additional $400 million \u2013 46 percent of the $865 million DeWine reeled in.\nTwo sidelights: Next year, Ohio will stop requiring front license plates. And legislators are fighting traffic cameras. (DeWine didn\u2019t seek either provision.) The highway bill requires the state to cut a local government\u2019s state aid, dollar for dollar, by the amount of traffic-camera fines that a local government collects. That\u2019ll likely make traffic-camera fines a wash for local governments. True, speed kills. So does running red lights and stop signs. But in practice, traffic cameras can amount to toll gates on the streets of money-hungry towns.\nSecuring the first fuel-tax increase since 2005 was a DeWine victory in terms of long-term investment in Ohio\u2019s needs. A key figure in helping get that done: House Speaker Larry Householder, a Republican from Perry County\u2019s Glenford. The Statehouse\u2019s three other top legislators, Senate President Larry Obhof, a Medina Republican, Senate Minority Leader Kenny Yuko, a Richmond Heights Democrat, and House Minority Leader Emilia Sykes, an Akron Democrat, also voted \u201cyes\u201d on the highway budget.\nIn DeWine\u2019s inaugural and state of the state speeches, he vowed that investing for Ohio\u2019s future would be his focus. The highway budget does that. For some General Assembly members, taking the long view is like switching from taking baby steps to running the policy sprints that Ohio so obviously needs.\nThe highway budget was one of the three big-stakes items the General Assembly will debate from now through June 30, when the current state operating budget expires. The second major item is to pass a new, two-year operating budget (House Bill 166), introduced on March 25, sponsored by Rep. Scott Oelslager, a Canton Republican, and pending in the House\u2019s Finance Committee.\nA third major debate looms, possibly the stickiest: A bailout \u2013 though at the Statehouse you\u2019re not supposed to call it that \u2013 of Ohio\u2019s nuclear power plants: The Perry plant (in Lake County\u2019s North Perry village) and Davis-Besse (in Ottawa County\u2019s Carroll Township, nine miles northeast of Oak Harbor).\nWhat\u2019s now FirstEnergy Corp. built both. Their owners are soon-to-be-independent FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.\nDavis-Besse is named for the late John K. Davis, once Toledo Edison Co.\u2019s chair, and the late Ralph M. Besse, once the Illuminating Co.\u2019s chair. Both utilities, with Ohio Edison, are now part of Akron-based FirstEnergy. Without a bailout (subsidies), the plants will shut down and shed jobs. Reason: The juice they produce costs more than power generated by ever-cheaper natural gas.\nPossible name for the bailout: The Clean Energy plan. It could surface this week in Ohio\u2019s House. It would apply to all forms of generation, not just nuclear, but also coal, gas, solar and wind. The measure would likely require Ohio electricity customers to pay a monthly charge \u2013 possibly $2.50 per residential customer, more than that for commercial and industrial customers. Key issue: Would each customer category pull its weight, or would residential customers\u2019 monthly charges subsidize commercial and industrial customers?\nOhio\u2019s Air Quality Development Authority would pool the monthly charges. Electricity generators, in exchange for cutting carbon emissions, or not producing any, could qualify for Air Quality Authority payments or tax credits. Solar and wind generators don\u2019t produce carbon emissions. Neither do nuclear plants. (They do produce nuclear waste.) If, as is logical, Clean Air payments or tax credits would be based on the number of low- or no-carbon kilowatts generated, Perry and Davis-Besse, huge electricity generators, would win big. Could the same be said for Ohio\u2019s residential utility customers?\nThomas Suddes, a member of the editorial board, writes from Athens.\nTo reach Thomas Suddes: tsuddes@cleveland.com, 216-999-4689\nHave something to say about this topic?

{"article": "China, South Korea, and Taiwan are all testing out 5G mobile networks, but unlike LTE, this new iteration of the wireless protocol will incorporate the world\u2019s first cellular system for 5G networks.\nIt\u2019s the next big mobile evolution\u2014and a major step forward. By enabling networks to consume and transmit even more data at faster speeds, mobile 5G will be able to make many apps we\u2019ve already taken for granted\u2014from Facebook Live to long-range WiFi\u2014faster and more reliable.\nAnd while at first glance, 5G sounds like a massive leap forward for telecoms companies\u2014who are scrambling to capture a share of 5G action\u2014the networks are not going to solve issues regarding energy usage and internet of things (IoT) connectivity. These issues aren\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon.\nDangers Of 5G\nAfter blazing through the 90s like a gasoline-powered supercar, the Internet of Things\u2014the much heralded \u201cnew infrastructure\u201d for connecting objects with information processors\u2014is now starting to be recognized for the logistical nightmare it is. Manufacturers and consumers alike remain unsure how exactly IoT\u2019s high energy demands, water pollution, and spying purposes will ever be regulated. And it\u2019s still unclear what these massive amounts of data will be used for.\nAccording to a recent report by the MIT Technology Review, it\u2019s now clear that by the early 2020s, these projects could go awry. 5G\u2019s higher energy demands, for example, are driving up energy use, which means more power bills to maintain 5G infrastructure, even though IoT won\u2019t \u201cmove\u201d any faster than it already does.\nSome companies are already having problems with 5G\u2019s speed\u2014South Korea Telecom\u2019s work in Monaco illustrates this perfectly.\nThe Future\nNot so much with IoT, but 5G, which we can expect to see in the U.S. and many other countries in the years to come. When it first came out in the Western world, LTE had the potential to finally bring reliable mobile Internet access to the developing world. That hasn\u2019t happened, and it\u2019s partly because of RF emissions: devices that communicate with LTE rely on radio waves that can degrade and maybe even die without enough sleep cycles to adjust back to a steady, constant rate of transmission.\nThe second problem: Wireless spectrum is limited. The same sources that are booming with IoT devices are no longer serving them. A big part of this is due to the billions of single-cell IoT devices that make up the IoT landscape. To help resolve this impending spectrum crunch, the 5G industry aims to have 6-12 gigahertz of spectrum available, twice what is available now. That is a much bigger haul than we currently have, but it will take years to make it happen.\nEven the predicted 5G population of 5 billion by 2020 will be barely visible when compared to our growing post-Internet smartphone addiction. As the 2020 5G deployment proceeds, U.S. companies and users alike will find themselves drawn to 5G over both LTE and IoT, and that may represent a major change. The American, and global, economy will depend on making bandwidth and battery life both plentiful, and increasingly affordable. We\u2019re currently in the middle of a technological and communications tug-of-war, but if we work together, we might soon see a winner.\n", "domain": "globalresearch.ca", "title": "5G: The Dominoes Are Starting to Fall - Global Research", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Claire Edwards", "ind30k": 6382, "url": "https://www.globalresearch.ca/5g-dominoes-starting-fall/5674715", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

He won the election, amid accusations of irregularities, winning 49.6 percent of the vote to the challenger\u2019s 47.4 percent.\nHe has faced an uphill battle to govern as his two main opposition challengers, Anies Baswedan of the opposition Democrat Party and Prabowo Subianto of the Gerindra Party, both decided to stay out of the contest this time.\n\u201cPresidential election in Indonesia. One of the most important in our history, an opportunity to restore peace and stability and a chance to lift up the economy,\u201d state-run news agency Antara quoted Widodo as saying.\nThe 2012 election saw rallies by nationalists calling for Widodo\u2019s ouster and thousands of Javanese protesters opposed to Baswedan.\nThreats of an Islamist backlash ahead of the election have heightened since the party of Jakarta Governor Basuki \u201cAhok\u201d Tjahaja Purnama formed a government in the country\u2019s capital last month.\nHabib Rizieq, the head of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), was charged with illegal assembly and inciting violence for his role in protests that led to the governor\u2019s imprisonment over blasphemy.\nThe same group was involved in mass protests against Widodo in 2016 after a video clip of him urging Jakarta residents to \u201cgo to the toilet\u201d was aired on TV.\nAt a rally in May last year, the government declared Purnama the target of a terror probe as he was seen in the video calling for people to vote against the head of state.\nUnder Widodo, Indonesia has progressed economically and has greatly improved social services, including healthcare, education and welfare.\nIndonesia was thrust into an international spotlight in 2015 when the husband of then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Agus Yudhoyono, took to Twitter to ask the International Criminal Court to investigate militant group Jemaah Islamiyah over its involvement in the attacks on the Palembang Marriott Hotel in Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people.\nThe UN Security Council has not endorsed a definition of terrorism.\nBut in March, Indonesia won its case against a United States-made Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) at the World Trade Organization in a ruling that called for US and Australian companies in Indonesia to pay compensation for not taking remedial measures after \u201cdefective\u201d equipment was used to fight the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) militant group.\n", "domain": "mangalorean.com", "title": "Indonesia votes to elect president, parliamentarians", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Please Enter Your Name Here", "ind30k": 3862, "url": "http://www.mangalorean.com/indonesia-votes-to-elect-president-parliamentarians/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Here are some metrics that could affect the results of first-quarter bank earnings reporting.\nShares of the biggest U.S. banks trade well below their recent peak levels and at levels below 10 times last year's earnings, suggesting investors expect fewer big price moves in the coming weeks.\nU.S. bank earnings are in for a 'show-me' earnings season in the first quarter, when results are due starting Tuesday evening. These results will give us an early read on whether the banks have been as productive in reversing their course after the start of the year.\nHere are some metrics that could affect the results of first-quarter bank earnings reporting.\nBroader Market Waters: As long as a majority of the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index are trading above their 52-week highs, investors will hold bank stocks to more stringent standards than they would if only a few stocks are trading above their 52-week highs. By contrast, many of the stocks in the S&P 500 moved lower during the past week. After a sharp drop, the S&P 500 is only 0.6% below its recent peak.\nBanks lower since the start of the year: Banks have been among the hardest hit stocks by the sell-off in global equities and the associated plunging oil prices. Smaller banks in particular were most dragged down by a 4.3% decline in the S&P SmallCap 600 index during the past week. If large banks are as undervalued as they are now, it may be little more than a matter of time before they recover. That said, investors will want to watch the broad market for any possible sign that it's nervous enough about financial issues, such as the weakness in commodity prices, to pull back on bank stocks.\nNew regulations: The heightened scrutiny from regulators has put many banking companies on high alert to comply with new rules and regulation. Fears of more costly costs, as well as threats to meet minimum regulatory capital levels, have prompted many investors to shun the industry and send stock prices lower. Banks with the highest capital levels and minimal exposure to Europe and emerging markets have the best shot at doing well when the market recovers.\nRevenue mixed: Here's where JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) shine: They reported consistently impressive revenue growth rates despite sluggish economic growth during the past four quarters. The industry should see continued gains in its core lending business when lenders start to get more profitable during the next few quarters. The one area of concern for Wells Fargo is the plunge in energy lending that continues even after the start of a surge in oil prices. Loan demand in the mortgage business remains soft, while the industry average for credit card issuance continues to climb.\nJPMorgan Chase's Adequate Credit: JPMorgan's first-quarter net income missed analyst expectations by a penny, but earnings per share at the bank rose 16%. The report was mostly healthy, and CEO Jamie Dimon offered an upbeat assessment of the first quarter of 2015. JPMorgan's pretax earnings surged 32% to $9.4 billion from the first quarter last year, he noted. However, the bank wrote off $726 million in loans in the energy sector, accounting for the difference between the reported net income of $1.9 billion and the consensus analyst forecast of $1.97 billion.\nWells Fargo's Valuation: Wells Fargo's revenue increased 5% year over year, with net income rising by 2%. An attractive valuation has also given investors reason to stay on the sidelines. The stock is priced at 8.5 times last year's earnings, compared with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 16.1. The company is expected to continue benefiting from its renewed focus on cross-selling loans and cross-selling financial products to its customers.\nCitigroup's Repeat Business: By comparison, Citigroup (NYSE:C) beat first-quarter earnings estimates by 3 cents, according to FactSet. The results were highlighted by a big jump in its investment banking business. The bank also saw better-than-expected performance in its consumer banking and private bank and better-than-expected earnings in its global banking group, which includes its retail banking operations. Wells Fargo's first-quarter earnings beat expectations by a penny.\nBanks are generally inexpensive: Stocks in the sector are cheaper than many other sectors, with net price-to-earnings ratios of 8.6 for the industry and 14.7 for JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Both companies are sitting on a pile of cash and do not currently have any plans to return that money to shareholders in the form of share buybacks or dividends.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to", "domain": "seekingalpha.com", "title": "Challenges Stack Up For Big Banks: Earnings Ahead For JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": "Jj Kinahan", "ind30k": 588, "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4253978-challenges-stack-big-banks-earnings-ahead-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-citigroup", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Others, she said, may have been confused about the programs, confused about their legal benefits, or having trouble understanding their Social Security numbers. This March, 42 percent of immigrant households\u2014about 5.2 million people\u2014didn\u2019t enroll in SNAP, according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That\u2019s up from about 28 percent in January. When Jan Osborne, the director of the SNAP program, surveyed SNAP recipients in February, the survey found that 34 percent said their status made it difficult to enroll, up from around 23 percent in 2016.\nAnd in March, nearly 30 percent of immigrants without legal status in the U.S. told researchers that they had stopped enrolling in Medicaid, up from about 22 percent in 2016. \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s increased tension and distrust of participating in public benefits,\u201d said McQuillan.\nWhile some immigrants may just lose interest in a program because it\u2019s not all that appealing, other signs indicate they are deliberately avoiding coverage, such as \u201clanding fees\u201d charged by local welfare agencies, for example. Nearly half of Latino immigrants reported having a land-finance officer tell them they couldn\u2019t get benefits, according to an ICE report reviewed by William Tate of the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nFor their part, ICE reported that its enforcement actions against illegal immigrants have led to the arrests of nearly 85,000 people nationwide. In February, nearly 11,000 immigrants were arrested by ICE.\nWhen a whole cohort of immigrants is simply leaving Medicaid, food stamps, and other critical public benefits behind, McQuillan said, it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t trust the public benefit system. And it\u2019s also clear that some low-income people are using bad information about the programs, such as that they are temporary benefits, and not permanent support that can be used to meet other basic needs.\nIt\u2019s no wonder. The Trump administration\u2019s active elimination of protections for certain immigrants and tighter immigration policy threatens to undermine a system that is vital to the well-being of everyone.\n", "domain": "theatlantic.com", "title": "Trump\u2019s Policies Are Scaring Immigrants Away From Essential Health Programs", "date": "April 25, 2019", "authors": "Olga Khazan", "ind30k": 3759, "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/04/trumps-immigration-proposal-hurting-immigrant-health/587908/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "One of the most remarkable things about Jett\u2014as her fan and creative collaborations, then popularity and subsequent rise to rock stardom prove\u2014is that at a moment in time when the #MeToo movement is getting regular magazine and internet coverage, she\u2019s doing just fine, thank you very much. The lead singer of iconic punk band The Runaways and singer-guitarist for the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s most badass band,\u201d she\u2019s running her own label, Blackheart Records, which launched the Kacy Hill album and single \u201cNothing Like You\u201d (the former is a hit on SiriusXM\u2019s Rhythmic 105), and has just released a long-awaited memoir, It\u2019s Not About the Music: My Life in Rock, Sex, and Rage.\nAnd yet her opinions on the movement are remarkably disarming. Speaking with The Daily Beast, Jett was cheerful and optimistic, and spoke not of a movement, but of the continued power and vitality of rock and pop music, women in power, and her own near-unique position in that pyramid. In fact, she\u2019s somewhat resistant to labels, and insists that music in general, and rock in particular, is a more powerful storytelling medium than most, more powerful than fiction, and better than most examples of \u201cself-glorification.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe music is the root of sexism, racism, elitism, and egotism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do with it, what you say with it, and how you present it that counts. Look, music is the ultimate form of human communication, and it\u2019s been that way since the beginning. What else do you need to say? Your poetry is a little bit poetry, then your voice or voice of a concert or stage show, is a little bit performance poetry, but music is rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, right? [Laughs.] We can\u2019t live without music in all of our lives. So I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the root of what is wrong.\u201d\nThe fact that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll hasn\u2019t always been the most welcoming place for women is only further proof of that, Jett said. \u201cReally? Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is supposed to be a place of rebellion and freedom? If music is the source of rebellion and freedom, how come there\u2019s not more rebellion and freedom in rock \u2019n\u2019 roll?\u201d\nAs for Jett\u2019s own historic relationship with rock and roll, how she felt after her Runaways single \u201cCherry Bomb\u201d came out in 1979, despite rock\u2019s mainstream embrace of hard rock bands like Aerosmith, Joan Jett on 8 Mile, and Nirvana, she didn\u2019t hold anything against the industry\u2014but she did remember her concern about the lyrics of \u201cCherry Bomb.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I did \u2018Cherry Bomb,\u2019 I said, \u2018You know what? They hate women in a way,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen people like Debbie Harry, Patti Smith, Kathleen Hanna, Grace Slick, they sang about the same thing, and I couldn\u2019t fucking tell. They were taking our loud songs and turning them into quiet songs. How could I tell who was saying it? I have a lot of experience with the industry and who I\u2019ve worked with, and I don\u2019t think I was the first person to play that song. What kind of world are we living in? It\u2019s obvious it\u2019s a very cynical industry, but at the same time, we weren\u2019t the first ones to say that.\u201d\nBut is there really any gender parity or equal opportunity for women in the music industry? Jett was noncommittal, but as one might imagine, her view on the subject is rather simplistic.\n\u201cThe facts speak for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t complain about it, because that\u2019s not the culture I grew up in. So the only thing I can say is that I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in a position where people know my name. I\u2019m glad the girls who came before me were in a position to have their name out there.

{"article": "New York City Transit's much-anticipated plan to replace the MetroCard will begin rolling out on March 15.\nThe de Blasio administration unveiled OMNY Monday, a bold plan to redesign the card that will go live at three different levels and replace the MetroCard with a single time-stamped smart card, a move Mayor Bill de Blasio believes will drive people into the subway and give trains new life.\nThe plan will replace the MetroCard with a subliminal electronic frequency on the back of the card that riders can pick up and move from one system to another. Riders can then swipe the new card on a reader to pay for a ticket.\n\"The single card works on everything,\" de Blasio said on Monday during his monthly radio show on WNYC, calling it \"the biggest systemic change to the fare since the introduction of the MetroCard.\"\nDuring a presentation on the plan at City Hall, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation said OMNY would save $40 million over 10 years. The savings are largely based on the frequency of the card, which would allow for better use of buses.\nMost people tap on and off the MetroCard every few minutes, creating conditions that allow buses to run more consistently throughout the day.\nUnder OMNY, however, riders will have to type in their full fare on both platforms \u2014 10-minute segments \u2014 so the subway system can communicate with buses to better pack riders on them at peak times. It would also create a targeted alert system for the first time.\nIf the subway train is less crowded on a certain platform, OMNY would notify the MTA of that and the street bus driver would then know to bring more passengers to the appropriate one, avoiding a first-class subway train in favor of a substandard minivan.\nThe suggestion came from five research groups, including the Regional Plan Association, which floated the idea several years ago.\nEat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nMTA Chairman Joe Lhota was among those who adopted the program, offering up the plan when he took the post in 2014. OMNY, however, is not universally accepted. Some officials have argued that a wider spectrum of frequencies would make more sense. Some say that if the system is going to work it needs to be in place within a few years, not in the next five.\n\"At a time when our region is experiencing one of the worst transit crises in modern times, we need New Yorkers to step up, be part of the solution and accept new risks in the hope of saving a city's future,\" the mayor said in a statement. \"These challenges are in the mind of every rider, and a MetroCard that won't work to where it is needed is not the answer.\"\nThe amount of cost savings, however, is the key selling point of OMNY \u2014 many transit observers, including those working with OMNY have cautioned that getting users to accept the new card and change the way they conduct themselves on the subway will be difficult. Some other major cities, including London, which was ahead of New York in the switch to smart cards, has not seen any such improvement.\nInstead, the tech that allows the cards to work has not been perfected, leaving mistakes and malfunctions, such as those that occurred on the London system, at the rear of people's minds.\nThe mayor's proposal is not for the system to automatically reroute riders, but it does not dispute the fact that errors will occur. Though OMNY will require that the MTA reconfigure stations, subway cars and buses, the mayor is committed to placing an \"extreme amount of trust\" in the city's Department of Transportation and other government agencies to follow through with their promises, he said.\n\"I'll take responsibility, but I will always be in the background and let other people try and improve on it, \" said de Blasio, adding that it will be up to the MTA to learn from the shortfalls when it comes to the card.\n", "domain": "amny.com", "title": "In introducing OMNY, the MetroCard replacement plan includes not repeating other cities' mistakes", "date": "April 02, 2019", "authors": "Vincent Barone", "ind30k": 2133, "url": "https://www.amny.com/transit/metrocard-replacement-omny-1.29297988", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Having a black parent has, in some ways, brought me out of my shell. But I know many other parents feel the same, and that their experiences may not be equally shared\n\u201cDo you sometimes wish you were black?\u201d\nAt school, this question from a white colleague makes me want to cry. This is an incredibly hurtful question and one that cuts deep to the core of the relationships between our children. Of course it could be one of many, or said out of ignorance, but I know there are many parents who would like to speak in a similar way. It has damaged relationships and careers, as well as generations of a community that has shared similar experiences.\nIt took me a long time to understand why this question isn\u2019t asked of all parents, of all cultures, of all backgrounds. I was not raised to talk about race, yet it is so fundamental to how I see the world. It affects everything. My parents are not from Africa but of Indian heritage; my dad from Delhi and my mum from Worcestershire. My mum always taught me that race doesn\u2019t matter and \u201cyou are who you are\u201d. It made me angry to hear people still using this kind of language, many who would accept me as I am. I can\u2019t possibly assume that my parents are someone\u2019s daughter or son.\nSo I don\u2019t really understand why they would feel the need to ask this question. In the case of my white colleague, it seems it is designed to highlight how different our lives are, in order to compare and contrast. I still feel hurt and angry that they could be thinking this, but I know I shouldn\u2019t be. That is not my world. The experience of my parents is not only different, it is starkly different.\nMy family\u2019s day trips are usually to places such as St Pancras, Devon or Lincolnshire, or London, and we\u2019ve been to numerous places of historical significance in the north of England, including Thirsk. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to travel abroad with my parents in the way that I wouldn\u2019t have done if they were white. We\u2019ve gone abroad during uni holidays, or on school trips and holidays.\nMy identity is diverse: I look like everyone else. In society and society at large, I can call myself British, Indian or Indian, and don\u2019t think twice about it. I recently got a job when I was too young to declare my ethnic background at a job interview, which was a bizarre feeling. Not being a minority (though I did feel in the minority at uni) means I don\u2019t have a public identity. So there is an issue around identity: I don\u2019t fully connect to the things that others do, which leads to me constantly thinking about my race.\nAt school, people often ask if I am Indian. Yet I don\u2019t get the same questions from teachers. I cannot claim that this is deliberate; sometimes it\u2019s just a question and I need to feel comfortable with myself in order to take a first step in answering it. One of the big struggles of being an identity-minimising parent is talking about race, because people never have a clear answer. The result is that race continues to play a huge role in our lives.\nIt feels like we are caught in a trap, one that only we know how to escape.

{"article": "A university student welfare body has questioned whether the Government\u2019s proposed cap on student ownership of student housing will achieve balance and fairness.\nSt Andrews Student\u2019s Welfare Association (SUSA) said it has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that government policies on student housing may exacerbate disadvantage and increase social isolation in the student community.\nLast year, the government introduced \u00a37,500 (\u00a32,000 year) property purchase limits as a mechanism to address the challenge of housing students by widening participation but it now wants to see where they can \u201cgo further\u201d.\nSUSA said the proposed limits \u201cignores the intrinsic differences in student lifestyles, and the practical variations and differences in circumstances for people seeking to rent privately\u201d.\nIn light of the current policy, the SUSA said it worries the Government may have opted to continue to concentrate much of the burden of social housing ownership in the private rented sector and further private ownership of student properties at the expense of the public sector.\nStudent renting will also be further restricted by having to post an \u00a38,000 (#4,000 year) deposit and restrict loans for students to a maximum of \u00a34,500 (#2,000 year) in future, it added.\nSUSA vice-president Hamish Toibin said: \u201cWe anticipate that many of the existing limited public sector housing stock will be withdrawn, further accelerating the pace of decline in those places with the greatest need in the market.\n\u201cWe are concerned this is not a balanced approach, where the state retains a reasonable degree of support to ensure that individuals not able to meet the new criteria have suitable accommodation.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe fear this could further exacerbate already elevated levels of social isolation among students who, on current plans, will have reduced choice.\u201d\nChairman of the Scottish Student Unions\u2019 political policy committee Mr Askey highlighted SUSA\u2019s reasons for registering its concerns.\nHe said: \u201cSince 2008, since more and more students are now finding it difficult to gain rental accommodation, the number of privately rented \u2018student bedsits\u2019 has increased dramatically.\n\u201cThis has been a major cause of concern for students and their associated bodies.\n\u201cWe felt it was important to register our dismay at this \u2018solution\u2019 for the chronic housing problems in our universities, because by itself it risks continuing and growing inequality for students.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the UK Minister for Students, Sam Gyimah, recently announced a review into the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme (CSS) to ensure current students can continue to access the programme until 2020.\nThe review has started to consider the eligibility of current students in England and Northern Ireland for academic awards of more than \u00a320,000 to undertake a postgraduate study under CSS.\nThe 2017 CSS Yearbook showed that 2,500 students in Scotland and 16,000 in England chose to study at a top ranked UK university while continuing on with a CSS scholarship during their first two years of study.\n", "domain": "thecourier.co.uk", "title": "St Andrews University \u2018doubtful\u2019 HMO cap will achieve balance and fair community", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Leeza Clark", "ind30k": 8626, "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/868821/st-andrews-university-doubtful-hmo-cap-will-achieve-balance-and-fair-community/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "BOSTON \u2014 Muzz and Zee.\nSounds like comic strip nicknames for two troublesome teens, who drive their elders and neighbours crazy with unpredictable antics.\nIn truth, all the talk about Jake Muzzin and Nikita Zaitsev around the Maple Leafs room is how they\u2019re proving an effective defence duo for Mike Babcock.\nIt\u2019s still early in their partnership and in this playoff series against Boston to say the coach has established the blueline blueprint that can take Toronto further into spring. But now that Babcock finally has six healthy defencemen to work with, he opted for the former Stanley Cup Winner from the Los Angeles Kings and the quiet Russian, who has been trying awhile to recapture his first-year success in T.O.\nThey had no better test than in Game 1 in raucous TD Garden, with a fair amount of time against the Leaf-killer \u201cPerfection Line\u201d of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak. As part of the main match-up with John Tavares\u2019 group, the two held the Bruin trio off the board at even strength, once Zaitsev got over some early-evening jitters.\nGoalie Frederik Andersen has a good vantage point to assess their combined impact.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been playing really hard and helped me out a lot,\u201d said Andersen. \u201cEspecially Muzz, the way he\u2019s been (communicating on the ice). He\u2019s been a Leaf a long time now (a late January trade), very mature and confident out there.\n\u201cHe helps out everyone, especially Zee. It\u2019s great to see them develop some chemistry, especially on the defensive side of the puck.\u201d\nBefore Muzzin arrived and during the time Jake Gardiner and Travis Dermott were hurt, the struggles of the defence contributed to a sluggish second half. Babcock first had to figure out how to deploy the left side defenceman and get Dermott settled on the right side. Then Gardiner\u2019s back issues had Zaitsev looking for a steady new partner, all the while putting more pressure on Morgan Rielly and Ron Hainsey at the top of the chain.\n\u201cI coached Muzz before (with Team Canada), so I\u2019ve got a pretty good handle on him,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cBut until you get him here and figure it out \u2026 it wasn\u2019t just about Muzz it was about our group and doing the best for him.\n\u201cThey seemed to have a good pairing. Muzzin is a guy who has done a lot of winning and understands what it takes and how to be a good pro. Gards is obviously just coming back and been off for a long time, Dermy\u2019s just coming back (from a shoulder injury), so we think that pair can be a lot better.\u201d\nZaitsev, not usually a talker, certainly warmed to the topic of Muzzin.\n\u201cI love it, great partner, great player. You have lots of stuff to look at what he\u2019s doing. We\u2019re always talking. We\u2019ll improve. We did a good job (Thursday), but it\u2019s only the first game.\u201d\nMuzzin hinted there\u2019s still a bit of a language barrier that prevents him getting to know the Muscovite more intimately, but that will come with time.\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky to play with him,\u201d Muzzin said. \u201cGood skater, feisty, hates being scored on. That\u2019s nice to have.\u201d\nZaitsev did have save Muzzin\u2019s bacon in the first period when the latter\u2019s shot was blocked up ice and Zaitsev found himself defending a potential 3-on-1. He dove at the puck carrier and spread himself long enough to break up the play.\n\u201cIt was a funny play, just good timing by me,\u201d shrugged Zaitsev. \u201cA second later, it\u2019s 1-on-1 (against Andersen).\u201d\n\u201cSometimes when you have a situation like that, it\u2019s best to slide and take away something,\u201d added Muzzin. \u201cIt forces the guy to make the play before he wants to (Zaitsev) made a great play on that one.\u201d\nThe pair know they\u2019ll have their hands full with Bergeron\u2019s line in Game 2.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that goes into it,\u201d Muzzin said. \u201cAll three guys can pass, all three can shoot and score. It\u2019s a five-man job. And Fred was there when we needed him.\n\u201cI thought we did a good job tracking them. I didn\u2019t find there was a lot of rush chances from them. The best way to stop those is to keep the puck and play in their zone.\u201d\nNET PROFIT FOR LEAFS\nBOSTON \u2014 With all the intense traffic around the net in playoffs, why not give your teammates a good reason to go there?\nThat\u2019s where Toronto\u2019s defence has been adept much of this year, getting pucks from the blueline through a forest of bodies on net or at least close to it to maximize the tipping ability of John Tavares, Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner.\nIt was a big reason Morgan Rielly had more than 70 points in regular season and will pick up some Norris Trophy consideration.\nOn Thursday, Toronto\u2019s first goal was Jake Muzzin getting a hard drive on net that Marner deflected off the post and pounced on his own rebound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial,\u201d said Muzzin, who picked up his 21st post-season point. \u201cPlayoff hockey is about that, getting pucks to the net, bodies to the net. Not all goals are pretty, especially around this time of year. They\u2019re feisty scramble-type goals.\n\u201cWe have to keep shooting and creating that chaos.\u201d\n\u2014 Lance Hornby\n", "domain": "torontosun.com", "title": "Muzz and Zee must be ready for Game 2", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "More Lance Hornby", "ind30k": 25111, "url": "https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/muzz-and-zee-must-be-ready-for-game-2", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.1909120706013371}

He created his first small plot project in 2012, however it is only this year that he has launched a company with staff and backing from philanthropists in Hyderabad.\nThe first projects, included a solar-powered drip irrigation system, to replace traditional hosing practices. A few months ago, he received funding for the second project. So far, he has spent close to Rs 12 lakh on the project, of which Rs 6 lakh were spent to pay for the farm equipment, which takes up three acres.\n\u201cTwo years ago, I applied for the funding scheme offered by the Andhra Pradesh government. Even as I waited for the response, I kept visiting agricultural markets around my village, and if someone said I should take up agriculture, I would do it,\u201d says Bikshu. In April last year, he moved to Hyderabad with his wife and two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.\nAdvertising\nNagar Bikshu, who in a childhood dream, wanted to become a movie director, took up agriculture after seeing young people from his village going abroad to work in power plants. \u201cI had seen film stars come from farmers\u2019 backgrounds. As a teacher, I would teach them when they got into debt or debt spiral, to save,\u201d he says.\nLooking at the problems faced by Indian farmers from his own village of Sanna in Kurnool district, Bikshu began experimenting with drip irrigation, slowly building up enough capital to run a farm. A year ago, he started his first project by buying a solar-powered drip irrigation system and a backpack machine to maintain it. With a wife who works as a laboratory assistant, as well as two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Bikshu has a busy household.\nWith each project, the work on small-scale farms does not require Bikshu to be in his office every day. This makes it possible for him to be more present in his community, spending time with people from different backgrounds.\u201dEven if it is three-fourths of the year, the day the parcel of land comes in, I need to spend four hours in the field doing farm chores, mostly organic, planting what I got and cultivating the land. So, I am in a better position to interact with village youth.\nA one-and-a-half acre plot is tiny, and the investment for the project is high. But, as he says, it was no easy matter. \u201cIt took us years of trial and error. Initially, we used hoses. However, hosing is heavy and can cause me to get injured. The water is also too salty, which hurts our feet and causes us to be unable to grow vegetables. So, I am doing organic farming, which is more consistent. I am ensuring only native plants and their season.\u201d This involves planting tobacco, onion, tomatoes, radish, pumpkin and baleweed. \u201cDrip irrigation has worked really well for us.\u201d\nIf the pump and equipment go bad, Bikshu says, he simply replaces them. \u201cWe don\u2019t waste water, and there are low water consumption plants on the farm.\u201d\n\u201cCurrently, I am also planting manchurian. There is no other vegetable in my village which grows like this. It requires a two-hour row, and I grow at least four rows.\u201d\nAdvertising\nHis challenge now is the time. He has to attend to the family members and take care of his business. For someone without formal education, there is also an English school, and he wants to spend time teaching there. \u201cOf course, it will be hard to teach somebody while I am also on the farm.\u201d\n", "domain": "morungexpress.com", "title": "How this Hyderabad social entrepreneur is using big data to change farmers\u2019 lives The Morung Express", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 2958, "url": "http://morungexpress.com/how-this-hyderabad-social-entrepreneur-is-using-big-data-to-change-farmers-lives/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "A bald eagle hatched at a wildlife sanctuary in Big Bear on Saturday, a months-long celebration of the species\u2019 resurgence following decades of decline in the wild.\nThe female eagle nest was one of three nested by bald eagles in the Eisenhower Park area of the water-side park, according to Big Bear City and Big Bear Wildlife Sanctuary officials.\nThe hatch was the first ever recorded at Big Bear City Park, officials said in a written statement.\nWhile many other eagles have already hatched from their nests in Big Bear City, wildlife specialists are pleased because they believe it reflects a larger trend toward a population boom in California\u2019s wildlife habitats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting that more and more people are recognizing and understanding the great health of our wild animals,\u201d said Dave Simpson, wildlife rehabilitator at Big Bear City and Big Bear Wildlife Sanctuary. \u201cWe hope that in some way this will encourage people to support the wildlife of the mountains.\u201d\nBald eagles were the state\u2019s largest bird, although that title has since been surpassed by other birds of prey.\nThey nested in California during the mid-1860s, but by the 1960s, the population had dwindled to a mere 300 or so nesting pairs. In 2007, researchers tracked 219 nests with an eye on getting the estimated number of pairs to 500, Simpson said.\nA four-year state-funded project helped to spur the recovery of bald eagles in California, according to an official profile.\nCalifornia Audubon launched the \u201cBald Eagle Recovery\u201d program in 1978. About 22 million adult eagles now exist in the wild.\nThe numbers were far from great when the project began, however.\n\u201cThere were approximately 100 nests estimated to have existed in the state in 1978,\u201d according to the profile. \u201cA closer review of that estimate resulted in a newer estimate of between 700 and 900 nests.\u201d\nEnvironmental groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior will celebrate the return of the eagles by having a \u201cState of the Bird\u201d event on Monday.\nThe high-profile event will feature representatives from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the San Bernardino National Forest, Birding Santa Barbara, the Bald Eagle Society, the National Audubon Society, and the Sierra Club.\nThe event is set to take place Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the wildlife sanctuary.\nAll attendees are encouraged to bring along binoculars, field guides and other tools needed to explore the park, according to a written statement.\nAnyone interested in making a donation to the event is encouraged to email BigBearCityPark at bigbearcitypark@gmail.com, officials said.\n", "domain": "ktla.com", "title": "Video: Bald Eagle Egg Hatches at Big Bear Lake", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "Brian Day", "ind30k": 2734, "url": "https://ktla.com/2019/04/13/watch-live-bald-eagle-egg-hatching/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Baku, Azerbaijan, April 15\nTrend:\nThe court hearing on the criminal case of former IBA Board of Directors member Mammad Guliyev, held April 15 in Baku's Sabail District Court, didn't reach any verdict.\nThe court's decision requires Guliyev to present before the court up to 14 days' written reply and under the procedure of this court he has to refrain from any activity that prevents the normal functioning of the commercial banking sector.\nSergei Kornilov, a lawyer for Guliyev, said at the hearing that his client was on vacation from March 24-April 14, when he was invited by the investigations and law enforcement agencies to provide them with information in connection with the criminal case.\n\"He did not receive any official warning that the criminal case was brought against him,\" said Kornilov. \"Therefore, he does not want to provide them with information.\"\n\"The IBA decides about Guliyev's retirement, the period during which he will retire, but the maximum period for retirement is three years,\" Kornilov said. \"Also, the law mandates that he should leave the IBA after serving a period of 21 years.

The IBA has prevented these transactions, otherwise why have they been forbidden?\"\nKornilov added that one of the items, which are not realized at the moment, is Guliyev's luxury apartment in Abu Dhabi.\n\"Despite the fact that Guliyev did not receive a salary from the IBA, he sold the gold to cover expenses,\" said Kornilov. \"Even Guliyev did not see the money [in Abu Dhabi]. If someone went there for vacation and tried to sell the gold, then the criminal case could be brought against him.\"\nIn late 2016, Guliyev was banned from holding any government office for three years.\nGuliyev, a resident of Mirsada village in the Aghdam region, was appointed IBA's board member in May 2016 and left the position in April 2018.\n---\nFollow the author on Twitter: @_AzizKazimov\nFollow Trend on Telegram.

{"article": "By KALTUM GUYO\nMore by this Author\nIn the week that we are told the Ministry of Education failed to spend Sh10 billion allocated to it, I wondered how many schools were failed in the country.\nThis article is not about the Sh10 billion, however, but more about wondering whether we need to think of ways to create equal standards across public schools to give children a level playing field in the job market.\nIf there is that kind of money not having been used in the face of crumbling schools, then I wonder what exactly is amiss in our education system.\nThe bone of contention between the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and ministry in the recent past was whether grades to the teacher training colleges needed to be lowered to D+ to address a chronic shortage of tutors.\nPERFORM POORLY\nIt was also a way to give counties that perform poorly in education a quota so that their residents can be absorbed into TTCs despite scoring lower grades.\nThe intention seems to be well founded, but it is a self-defeating exercise. All it would do is flat-line literacy levels in perpetuity in the areas that desperately require radical reforms to improve education standards.\nGarbage in, garbage out. Unless the teacher with a lower overall grade has something exceptional to offer, it would be a case of recycling failure.\nI do understand that some people reach higher acumen plateau with experience despite lower achievements in school, but it is a gamble that is not worth taking for the sake of our children\u2019s future, and not in the competitive global market systems.\nCURRICULUM\nStandardisation does not begin and end with school curriculum. Education must consider school environment as well.\nThis is to ensure that buildings meet an acceptable standard of habitation. What we have is schools that operate in diverse systems: You have schools in one area that are well resourced to have extra swimming pools and buses and state-of-the-art laboratories and others which have children studying in mud-walled classrooms with leaking grass-thatched roofs, stones for seats and toileting in the grass!\nStandardising education would mean all schools meet basic acceptable standards in which children can learn well.\nThere is no need to pan to political interests to just pop up schools that are unfit and unfair for children to learn in. There are schools that have never even heard of a science lab, let alone have one.\nSCIENTISTS\nWhat chance does that school have to inspire future scientists in their communities?\nMost schools have no libraries within the school, in the village or in nearby towns. These are facilities that are crucial in helping nurture an enthusiastic child who may, otherwise, have never had the opportunity to access study materials due to poverty.\nThe film, The Boy who Harnessed the Wind (recommended for every school) is about an African child who found a way to save his village by building a wind turbine to provide water for his community during famine. His interest in the turbine was piqued by a book he found by chance at his lowly equipped library in his poorly built village school in Malawi.\nIt is mind-boggling to imagine how many such enthusiastic children lost out in life due to being let down by the education system and government policies that are geared less towards the poor.\nFAITH\nOne other issue worth considering, particularly in areas with a Muslim majority, is introduction of a faith-based school system. These are areas with one of the lowest literacy levels, worse among women.\nCounties such as Garissa, Mandera, Wajir and pockets of the coastal region with higher Muslim populations could benefit from having schools built on their faith.\nThe idea is to have a hybrid system based on religious teachings and the national curriculum. The system is more reassuring to Muslim parents who are still unsure of mainstream schools for cultural reasons.\nSchools built on the Christian faith have done very well in improving literacy levels. It is a template worth considering to boost the number of girls attending schools in communities that hinder girls\u2019 education. The move could work towards improving socio-economic status of girls and women from conservative areas.\nINEQUALITY\nNot equipping or funding schools denies many youngsters a lifetime of opportunities. It\u2019s worth noting that education is a fundamental right as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe current education system in Kenya creates inequality. There is a need to plan for a standardised education system that would consider all factors in order to create a level playing field.\nThe school environment, undoubtedly, plays a large part in shaping behavioural patterns and helps in creating quality human resource. It\u2019s crucial, therefore, to ensure young people grow with the mindset that they are equal to their peers globally.\n", "domain": "nation.co.ke", "title": "GUYO: Create equal standards to give all students level playing", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "More This Author", "ind30k": 964, "url": "https://www.nation.co.ke/oped/opinion/Create-equal-standards-to-give-all-students-level-playing-field/440808-5071696-v9wqcf/index.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.19665733491763643}
{"article": "Armstrong laughed. He was a shy man who preferred to snuggle up to a mate rather than set himself up in front of a public microphone, confident he wouldn't be that interesting, that everyone would know it's not the kind of thing a sporting hero should talk about in public.\nIf Armstrong was a much-needed breeze in a desert, it is doubtful would have been able to find an interested observer. He was more of a one-trick pony. His motorcycle collection was flashy. His brand, Lagonda, was bankrolled by an American group with an identity as quintessentially swaggering as Armstrong himself.\nAn American culture of excess, one highlighted by the excesses of NBA star LeBron James, is often accused of being similar to the one inherent in Australian sporting culture. Sportspeople are supposed to be humble, not ostentatious. Even so, Armstrong held the perfect niche for the NBA era, simply because his nickname \"The Captain\" was a popular expression of joy in Australia.\nTrained a generation\nAsked to describe what his team did, it was clear neither he nor many of his teammates knew. Regardless, they were confident those who did saw a team of more than just three stars. Armstrong's value lay in his ability to train a generation, many of whom were from humble backgrounds with a work ethic that would have been strengthened by coming through a dominant, athletic group.\nIn the 1990s, Australians boasted a fraction of the regular visitors to the NBA they have in the present day. In 1998, 15 per cent of all players in the league were Australians.\nIn 2018, that figure stands at a further 2.3 per cent. For a sport that has a pedigree of athletes such as Chris Judd, Brendan Fevola and Patty Mills, and a history that entailed various basketball stars, Kieren Jack and Dennis Frank, with relatives in London, Jason Hart and Charles Anderson and Shane Heal, it should not be that high.\n", "domain": "smh.com.au", "title": "The man who could not be stopped: GI had the rarest of gifts", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Phil Lutton", "ind30k": 964, "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/the-man-who-could-not-be-stopped-gi-had-the-rarest-of-gifts-20190415-p51ecu.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Ordinary shares are not registered in Jamaica and so you do not receive a statement of the ownership as you do a bond, which is the equivalent of a security.\nMost common shares were issued in the days of colonial rule when there was no legal limit on who could own them. With the listing of shares on the Jamaica Stock Exchange in 1986, the common shares are a listed class of shares that gives its owners the opportunity to choose the best possible financial products to represent them.\nIt can also be said that common shares are traded as securities. Indeed, of the companies listed on the exchange, in recent times, only just over half have regular trading on the exchange, or more often, on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) At a basic level, investment accounts are held at financial institutions and in which the holder of the money, or that amount, is required to invest, in a specified asset, such as securities.\nBuying securities\nThe way to invest in securities is in a pension fund or a bond. But the stocks on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) are almost the only tradable securities, and it is an unregulated market, though various kinds of bonds exist. They include depositary receipts or certificates for which the securities, particularly, the ordinary shares, can be traded, listed and traded, or traded and listed on their own free-float, or open market, of number.\nIf shares are registered in Jamaica and listed on the JSE, the central agency responsible for registering shares is the Jamaica Stock Exchange. You can see from the menu list above that those listed on the JSE were registered between the end of March 1996 and the end of October 2015.\nIn this article, Ordinary shares are being explained as the certificates represented by those shares that represent the entire shareholding of the company. Ordinary shares represent only your ownership of the shares but not, by regulation, any other securities.\nIn more advanced trading, shares are traded as more than one securities. For example, most American money managers buy and sell listed securities, real estate investment trusts, preferreds, bonds, preferred shares, and trust or inverse bond funds. A small number buy and sell baskets of securities.\nDiversity of assets\nA common law shareholders who owns only ordinary shares normally owns only the shares. Ordinary shares belong to the holder and are his or her name, or his or her/itsalter ego\u2019s name, on the account. A fractional share is one share more than five percent of the common shares.\nYou should consider the quality of the company and its ability to pay dividends in considering whether to buy Ordinary shares. It is important to note that not all companies pay dividends. When, or if, a company does pay a dividend, it is important to look at the quality of the dividend in calculating its basis. This is very critical as not all dividends will be the same size and not all are funded from earnings.\nThe cash generated by the company is what provides the basis on which to calculate the dividend. It is possible to ignore the cash, looking only at the amount paid out as a percentage of the total earnings of the company.\nThe dividend, although it is usually said that the Company paid $0.70 in dividends to the shareholders, is paid as a percentage of the profit it generated for the period. Based on the company\u2019s profit of $4.56 billion in 2018, for example, a $0.70 per share dividend can be said to be a 40 per cent payout.\nIn dividend-paying companies, the issue of shares is a major source of cash. When shares are issued, the Company or Company\u2019s common shareholders receive a portion of the gross proceeds of the issue, probably less than 60 per cent. In some cases, the shares are convertible, usually into cash.\nFurther, ordinary shares are alloted by way of the issuing company without consideration of the size or the name of the shareholder. Typically, the issuing company, for accounting purposes, disburses the money to the shareholder.\nI suggest that you do a little homework before buying Ordinary shares.\nn Oran A.

{"article": "Pennsylvania lawmakers set aside objections and reform is in store for the state\u2019s public employees who have committed crimes ranging from first-degree murder to sex crimes to indecency with a child.\nThe state Senate voted 61-11 on Monday to approve House Bill 1736 which stops public employees who are convicted of a felony related to the public\u2019s interest from receiving their pensions for five years or the life of the offender after they leave their position.\nHB 1736 now moves to the House for further consideration.\nThe measure addresses several issues that have surfaced in the past and any retirement benefits for the 29,000 state workers and nearly 100,000 members of the Public School Employees Retirement System who are eligible for them.\nRetirement benefits for court employees, justices and judges will not be affected by the measure.\nSenate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre County, said it\u2019s not going to affect him personally but will affect people he represents who have worked for the state for a long time and have dedicated themselves to serving and protecting the public.\nHe noted it also is intended to not encourage public employees to commit crimes because they will feel pressure to do so at the risk of jeopardizing their pension benefits.\n\u201cThe reason why we are focusing on public employees is because we have had problems with them in the past and we would like to keep that from happening again,\u201d Corman said.\nSpecifically, the measure would not apply to former legislators or current, elected representatives of local governments.\nWhile Corman is supportive of this bill, he said he\u2019s open to changing it to address more of the concerns he heard during a legislative hearing and debate on the measure on Monday.\n\u201cThere are some things in there that might still upset some folks that are paying into the system so hopefully we can find some changes and remove some of the concerns people have brought up,\u201d he said.\nAnother critic who testified at Monday\u2019s hearing is Lourdes Melendez of Ladd Township.\nShe\u2019s a major sponsor of HB 1736 and said this bill is an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship between the lawmakers and their employees. She\u2019s also worried that ending these employees\u2019 pensions might prevent public officials from firing or suspending them in the future when they have other unresolved professional matters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re afraid that public employees, their representatives, and their legislators are going to take these employees into consideration when they make decisions,\u201d she said.\nThe House Judiciary Committee passed a version of this bill in November without seeking any input from the pension system because it didn\u2019t qualify as a financial necessity as the members of PERS are enrolled in the system for decades and paid into the system and are currently enjoying the benefit of the system when they retire.\nTrevor Schnitter, executive director of the PERS board, said Monday the board is reviewing HB 1736. It\u2019s under review as part of a long-term reform process for PERS that will continue during the current Legislative session.\nHe noted the final draft of the Legislature\u2019s proposed plan to eliminate the state\u2019s troubled, unfunded pension liability and the constitutional reform bill Gov. Tom Wolf signed last week created the future standard for termination of PERS benefits for public employees.\n\u201cBecause this bill applies to the current members of PERS, the PERS board feels it is too early to make a determination on the ramifications this bill may have for PERS and our members,\u201d Schnitter said.\n", "domain": "pennlive.com", "title": "Pa. public employees convicted of sex crimes could lose pensions", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Jan Murphy", "ind30k": 1888, "url": "https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/04/pa-public-employees-convicted-of-sex-crimes-could-lose-pensions.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- It was already evident from our Readers' Choice poll for the Best Mexican Restaurant in Northeast Ohio that Ciudad on Coventry was far and away the best contender in the \"On Coventry\" area.\nDowntown Cleveland has far more restaurants, and surely more choices for Mexican, with hundreds more chefs to recommend. It's nearly impossible to name a best or perfect place for Mexican.\nWe launched our \"Northeast Ohio's Best\" contest back in February to find the best of the best among traditional and modern Mexican restaurants. We compiled a list of 68 semifinalists. We then asked you to vote in our poll for your favorite.\nCiudad, that's \"always\" in its name, on Coventry in Cleveland Heights opened in 2010, with a chef named Juan Rosado. The concept has evolved and it now employs a half-dozen chefs, including brothers Arturo and Eduardo Martinez. Arturo Martinez is still involved and named two entries into our top 20 finalists.\nArturo and Eduardo Martinez operate Casa Arturo, which is a contemporary Mexican bar and restaurant, and Casa Rosado, which is a casual family-style eatery with authentic Mexican fare.\nIn our full list of finalists, we also listed restaurants that partnered with Ciudad on special occasions, as they have in past years, such as Casa Arturo's Margarita Cocktail Mixer last November.\nCiudad's restaurants are run by its own staff, and serving as a sponsor is a way to connect customers with the food they love.\nAn integral part of its success has been that chef-owners can watch the food come to the tables, as opposed to traditional Mexican restaurants that have chefs who prepare food on location.\n\"We have access to our chefs as often as we want to,\" Arturo Martinez said. \"If they want to cook that special menu that evening for an event we can feed their guests to them.\"\nThey also eat at the restaurants for employees and guests.\nAlso essential to Ciudad's success is that all its restaurants are family-run, Arturo Martinez said. He and Eduardo Martinez are the sons of Angeli and Juan Rosado, who started the business nearly 30 years ago.\n\"Most of the chefs we have, especially those from the sister restaurant, graduated from our culinary school,\" Arturo Martinez said. \"We also have to be always open to all our chefs. Any of them, if they want to work for us and their talents fit into what we're doing, we'd gladly bring them on.\"\nSince opening the first Ciudad restaurant in 1985, Juan Rosado has been a partner in each of the locations. Now the Rosado's live and work in Lorain, where Juan Rosado works for the DMV. Arturo Martinez said if he had to pick a favorite he has to be associated with the Coventry location.\n\"I grew up as a teenager working there when I was 16 years old,\" Arturo Martinez said. \"It was my first restaurant.\"\nThe father and son say family is the key to their success.\n\"Cristian and I had the ball,\" Arturo Martinez said. \"We kind of raised two boys.\"\nMartinez, who also owns the art gallery Grind City, believes the restaurants have had that family feeling since they opened the first one.\nCiudad owner Arturo Martinez, shown here working at a party held at Casa Arturo, joins us as a finalist for Best Mexican Restaurant in Northeast Ohio. (Photo provided)\n\"You need to have people around you that know your family,\" he said. \"You need to build a family relationship and have the trust of your employees. These restaurants have gotten to where they are because of our commitment to them.\"\nThe Martinez brothers plan to open a new restaurant in May inside Playhouse Square.\n\"I am super excited,\" Arturo Martinez said. \"It's a tremendous concept restaurant for us. I am sure that the food is going to be really, really good.\"\nMartinez said he wanted to start off with a restaurant in Playhouse Square because he saw that there were other restaurants there, not just Mexican, but other cuisines as well.\n\"That's the game we have to play,\" he said. \"Food is a great connector.\"\nYou can read more about the 20 finalists -- a list that also includes booths of Pueblo, Cueva, Nuevo or \"on the beach\" Mexican restaurants -- on cleveland.com.

{"article": "I have been reading and studying his book over the past few days. In his presentation of several well researched articles, he does not give more than one week. So, in the past month, we were much glued to the pages of this book. We have read several articles, an extensive collection of photographs, including pictures from the \u2018BBC Curry Review\u2019 and many other articles from different countries.\nHis research has greatly helped me and I feel proud to know that my child is doing some really good work and because of his hard work in these studies, a good deal of work is getting done on the children of this country. Being our children\u2019s advocate, I also learn a great deal from him. I\u2019ve been reading his articles from a beginning to end basis, and found them informative, interesting and sometimes distressing but this is the pleasure that I get from his writing.\nHe shares the challenges for our children in our country, particularly our poor child. I have seen many kids at the same age, which he uses in his articles. It\u2019s good to know that some of them are doing reasonably well and I am very happy that they are coming up to the mark.\nI am a bit concerned about the kids from areas like the national capital which have received some attention from the doctors and the government for this social problem. There are many kids struggling and sleeping in their homes without any facilities because of their poor conditions.\nHis research has greatly helped me and I feel proud to know that my child is doing some really good work and because of his hard work in these studies, a good deal of work is getting done on the children of this country.\nI first visited his home when he was seven and I gave him and his brother, Arbaaz a toy gun and a large tennis ball which he would play with. My friend arranged for him and his brother, Mr Syed Ali to get an eye-screening and polio vaccination. Mr Syed Ali who is a member of Pakistan cricket team, also told me that he had recently signed a contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board to assist in the field of medicine and immunisation.\nHe told me that he is coming to Pakistan for the first time in his life to be with his mother. Being the mother of four young boys, he would like to be closer to his parents. He said he had an enviable career as a match-winning cricketer and had appeared in many international matches.\nI observed that Mr Syed Ali\u2019s speech remained nice and he gave excellent compliments to people that had helped him. He said he is anxious to get over this stage with the help of his family and some organizations and to start writing more for this wonderful country.\nIn his presentation, he gave very relevant points, especially that he wants to make our children as aware of world and America.\nHe also said that he hopes that our nation will be used in greater social service. The children would be involved in the fight against social evils by giving lectures at the home, schools and others locations. He said that there is need to teach children skills of character building, saying that some children come from the poorest families and have a small pocket of wealth and it would be a shame if they are left on their own and not taught how to lead a good life. He said the country is too important for him to remain on the streets of Lahore.\nHe was a contented person, and not the kind of person that one would want to give a tough time to because he is the kind of person who wants to have a good life for himself and his family and just want to contribute his small share of the country\u2019s development. It is a great cause to strive for, especially when he realizes that many of his rich cousins, who are somehow stuck in places like Dubai or London and at the same time do not contribute much to their country, have workarounds like working abroad but still send money to their country. The proud moment for them is when the entire family can come together and celebrate or recite a national song with joyous abandon!\nAnd in my defence, he has six brothers and one sister to follow and I mean to join them in whatever they do.\nI\u2019m sure they will feel proud of their brother\u2019s achievement. And I would like to request those who may be concerned about child labour and other forms of exploitation to make aware about the opportunities we have here in Pakistan.

{"article": "By Wam\nAl Ain Zoo has launched its new plans to diversify revenue streams and expand its green living initiatives as well as plans to collect funds from donations and visitors\u2019 fees, as part of the 20th anniversary celebrations of the zoo.\nAs part of this strategy, the Zoo will implement three major projects: construction of a 100,000 square metre zoo lagoon; a 45,000 square metre Dh50 million enclosures building; and collection of an annual Dh3 million from donations and visitors\u2019 fees.\nWhile the process of seeking necessary approvals from the authority, and financial assistance from the concerned authorities to start construction works is in its final stages, building has already started.\nThe lagoon was designed with a height of 15.6 meters above sea level and 40,000 m2 capacity of over two million litres. To make up for the difficulties of moving animals and water around the lagoon, several special systems have been installed for survival of these creatures.\nThe new enclosures building, built to house six enclosures and 50 species of birds, fish and mammals, will create new opportunities for species such as: two newly introduced species, Grafallous and Great Lions, a cheetah, five wildebeest, and zebra.\nThe zoo\u2019s Dh50 million plan to raise funds from donations and visitors\u2019 fees will also include a commercial, scientific and educational complex in which live animals will be exhibited for educational sessions as well as available for viewing by visitors free of charge.\nFor the first time in the history of the Zoo, the Al Ain Zoo now has an abundance of urban gardens at the zoo. Its partners were therefore also contacted by the zoo\u2019s management to contribute to the city\u2019s garden project.\nMeanwhile, visitors now have greater opportunities to keep a close watch on animals living within the Zoo from their mobile devices and cameras thanks to the setting up of a 24-hour smartphone application, which offers a range of interesting animals and nature images and videos. The application is provided free of charge and can be downloaded on any smart phone or tablet.\nThe popularity of the Zoo\u2019s communication with its visitors on social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, has also significantly increased, making it the number one destination for the smart generation. More than 10,000 visitors have signed up for the Zoo\u2019s official Facebook page, which receives about 300-400 comments daily, whilst more than 160 people comment on the Zoo\u2019s official Twitter account every day.\n\"The UAE as well as Al Ain had long been showcasing the most innovative creatures and plants in the region and world,\" said Abdulla Al Fahim, Executive Director of Al Ain Zoo, adding that, \"Zoo\u2019s passionate staff and visitors also play a major role in ensuring that these animals and plants, which are carefully monitored by the zoo\u2019s scientists, receive the best possible care\".\nTo mark this significant anniversary, the zoo\u2019s founding Director Sheikh Muhammad bin Dhaher Al Nahyan inaugurated the fourth and final new addition to the Zoo\u2019s collection in December 2014.

{"article": "By JOHN NGIRACHU\nMore by this Author\nThe suspension of President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s tax regime has been thrown into confusion by the Ministry of Lands.\nIn a press statement, Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney told the press that she had just been informed that the High Court had suspended the move to charge fees for land titles, even as the President continued rolling out a tax directive that would force land owners to pay Sh500 for every title deed issued.\n\u201cThe Acting Chief Registrar has confirmed that the High Court suspended the tax on Land Titles Registration Fees and orders and all others according to the Rules and Acts published on April 11, 2019,\u201d Ms Karoney said.\nThe suspension came after Justice Isaac Lenaola, of the High Court, issued the interim order while hearing a case in which the PSD Act has been challenged.\nShe gave the ministry a month to file a response to the petition by Bungoma resident Dominic Kiprop Kariuki who claimed that the government was not serious about ensuring that the taxes will be collected as ordered by the law.\nAnd just like that, the presidential directive issued last week granting tax relief to over 17 million Kenyans whose mortgages are backed by Kenya Revenue Authority \u201cstands.\u201d\nThe Treasury had asked the courts to suspend the implementation of President Kenyatta\u2019s Housing Levy until the law could be repealed by Parliament.\nRESCIND ORDER\nIn a statement issued on Monday, Ms Karoney said her ministry had complied with the directive to revert to the 2013/14 regulations and immediately initiated the recapture and recapture and remit the amounts collected from beneficiaries of the scheme until the court decision is set aside.\n\u201cThe Ministry will also proceed with the filing of judicial review applications by affected interest groups,\u201d she said.\nThe suspended fees for land titles, she said, had become operational on April 11 and had been collected by KRA and KRA officers at registries.\nShe asked KRA to ensure that the funds collected are returned to the Kenyan taxpayer.\n\u201cIn the meantime, all clients awaiting payment of the fees have been directed to report to their Registrar of Titles at the time of issuance of the title deed,\u201d she said.\nLand owners should note that not all applications of newly issued titles are processed by the Government, but by private companies who collect and record information for the different departments in the ministry.\nThis includes those from private banks and the Registrar of Deeds.\n\u201cThe identification of the accounts at which the fees will be paid will be within the next 10 days,\u201d Ms Karoney said.\nGOVT SANCTIONS\nThe suspension comes even as the Treasury has threatened a raft of sanctions against developers as well as the national and county governments who fail to inform its decision on interest rate caps.\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury issued a circular saying that it will take the following action if the affected lenders are not in compliance: The Treasury may refuse to issue another individual or company with a loan, cancel the current loan or refusal to issue a new loan and convert the loan to a revolving or term loan.\nIt may also cancel the holder\u2019s business licence and refuse to renew it for the period that the suspension has elapsed.\nThe chairman of the Land Registration Fees Implementation Committee Mr Orwa Ojode told the Nation on Tuesday that the government\u2019s decision to suspend implementation of the tax applied to commercial banks.\n", "domain": "nation.co.ke", "title": "Temporary reprieve as court suspends Uhuru\u2019s Housing Levy \u2013 VIDEO", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 7837, "url": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/temporary-reprieve-as-court-suspends-uhurus-housing-levy", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Despite its many nuanced conclusions \u2013 and its utter lack of \"soft power\" \u2013 A History of the Mandate of Palestine does not shy away from the subject of the 1948 War of Independence that swept through a number of Arab countries \u2013 including the Muslim nation of Palestine. And so, as with any study of historical events \u2013 be they Western (Vietnam) or Muslim (Pakistan), North or South \u2013 the bloodshed and displacement is all but unavoidable.\nBut there's a curious thing about this book: Despite the existence of a book in the UK called about the same subject back in 1968, whose two editor-researchers went through the same sort of government-mandated research a long time ago, this book is titled A History of the Mandate of Palestine.\nThat book, issued by the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is called Towards a History of the Mandate of Palestine, and its author is the inimitable Laurie Graham \u2013 in other words, one of the greatest chroniclers of British imperialism in the Middle East ever.\nA History of the Mandate of Palestine, on the other hand, is by Peter Taylor. An Old Testament scholar at Cambridge, Taylor is also a journalist \u2013 his well-received study of George W. Bush's faith-based initiative, The Road to 9/11, is still one of the definitive books on the subject. In a sense, that book and A History of the Mandate of Palestine are that point in the timeline, each weaving a story together that suggests one meaning upon another.\nBoth are about the war over the prospect of Greater Israel, which both author and publisher want to see as nothing less than the more peaceful option \u2013 however loosely applicable that is.\nA History of the Mandate of Palestine was designed as a trade-mark, so in every segment of the book there's a hyperlinked text that points the reader to information on another part of the book. Similarly, the two books coincide on a number of the major themes of the book.\nBoth grapple with political concepts of citizenship, as well as the geopolitical consequences of the actions of the British Empire. Both acknowledge the violent plight of the refugees of 1948, and the propaganda battle over this issue that the victorious Israelis proceeded to wage right up to the 1967 War of Independence, when the Arabs were forced to join the newly created Palestinian state.\nThe most obvious difference between the two books is the author's willingness to acknowledge the alternative conclusion to that war. Here, A History of the Mandate of Palestine begins with the \"leading British Zionist official\" \u2013 who was a Palestinian, if you must know \u2013 declaring, \"We have always attempted to introduce as many as possible of the Jews into Palestine in order to complete the territorial reorganization.\"\nBut even this candid acknowledgement of the splintering of the British Empire is not from \"A History of the Mandate of Palestine,\" but from \"And the Mideast Conquered,\" a prose-poem published back in 1974 by Kenneth Watkin.\nWhat's so curious about this book is that neither author seemed to be making the point that the long Palestinian-Israeli conflict was not, in and of itself, about whether or not the Jewish people had the right to live in Palestine. That divide was certainly there, as noted by both, but what's missing from both, and what is, of course, non-negotiable for many Israelis, is the notion that the majority of the Palestinians are tied to the state of Israel, with Israel's freedoms and dignity tied up with their own.\nThe other problem of course is that neither author, with the exception of Kenneth Watkin, avoids the full list of failed efforts to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, focusing instead on the various price tags that were assigned to the Israelis and Palestinians, who, despite any bloodshed, still failed to make peace. In the end, it seems that the gaps can't be bridged and \u2013 if both sides are to come to their senses \u2013 that's it, and that's it.\nIt's an ancient, and incompletely understood, dispute, and that makes it hard to boil it down, into simple answers and solutions.\nAnd so, as a scholar of the Middle East and as a historian, I fear that neither of these books is likely to change anyone's mind on the subject. On the contrary, I think that they both suggest that the resolution of this conflict is clearly one of the great unfulfilled political desires of the 20th century.\n", "domain": "csmonitor.com", "title": "What was the North fighting for?", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": "The Christian Science Monitor, Steve Donoghue", "ind30k": 4162, "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2019/0411/What-was-the-North-fighting-for", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "By Warren Ashby\nMoat Investing is a philosophy that explains how the leaders in a given industry \u2014 the names that appear on the corporate roster of Fortune 500 companies \u2014 tend to be similarly positioned. The theory was first explained by Dalbar, an investment research company, in 1993 and suggested that management teams at well-established firms had built and maintained a competitive advantage by maintaining a relationship with customers, employees, suppliers, and other relationships that led to monopolistic conditions.\nIn the years since Dalbar created the theory, it has become a favored way of constructing investment portfolios, with thousands of professional funds constructing portfolios based on the theory. Materially, the theory is more about identifying the characteristics that distinguish a company from its competitors, but the conclusion can apply to other investment styles as well.\nSome of the traits that make a company an effective leader in an industry include:\nKnowledge and understanding of the overall market: Our perception of the stability of price, supply, and demand in the overall market helps us make sense of the short-term fluctuations in share prices.\nManagement has built and maintained relationships with its customers and suppliers: Management using social capital and/or relationships with the customer is positioned to grow and survive in the marketplace and have the ability to adjust quickly when changes occur.\nManagement has built and maintained relationships with employees: Employees like and stay with a company because of the culture that develops.\nWork environment: The culture and work environment of a company is an important intangible that enables a company to continue to successfully operate and grow in the market.\nAs in any investing process, each of these factors has a role to play and together yield a recipe for success.\n", "domain": "etftrends.com", "title": "Moat Investing: Keeping Up with the Joneses", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Special To Etf Trends", "ind30k": 8991, "url": "https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/moat-investing-keeping-up-with-the-joneses/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nOne of the most debated characters in Game of Thrones is Jon Snow. The \"Prince Who Was Promised\" has gone from hero to villain and back again as Jon struggles to defeat his band of renegade Wildlings to replace the Night King as Ironborn ruler of the north.\nWhile he's arguably the biggest \"hero\" in Westeros, Jon Snow is nowhere near a character we would recognize as having true nobility. He's the bastard son of Ned Stark. He never assumed the mantle of Kingslayer, replaced his father as heir to the Iron Throne, and after kicking the Purple Wedding ass has nearly become King of the North. He's got it all but a little less-than-smart Jon is falling under the thumb of the ruthless Ramsay Bolton. His exploits are displayed in the books, but TV's still just starting to get really deep into the Ned Stark character. So why is he who some fans love to hate? It's the harsh reality of the Game of Thrones franchise that Lord Jon and Daenerys Targaryen are the ideal kings.\nRelated: Game of Thrones Theory: A King In The North As Prince Who Was Promised Can't Be A Bully\nOddly enough, while both Jon and Dany are pretty \"normal\" in terms of being honorable folk, their roles are reversed when it comes to true power. Dany was always a reluctant Targaryen who barely held her position in her own brother's court. Jon Snow is a true Stark, though we've often see his vulnerability. He's equally tired, just how the show's argument is that the people need a leader like the Dreamy Prince. Jon's story has seen him do incredible things, yet he's still one of the most interesting characters on the show, getting colder in many ways.\nWhat's Hot on Game of Thrones: The Fall of Jon Snow\nGame of Thrones' Robin Hood Scribe Is Working On A Prequel Pilot\nCheck out all of Screen Rant's Game of Thrones coverage.\nThis Page: Game of Thrones' The Prince Who Was Promised\nPage 2: Game of Thrones' Dany's True Strength\nGame of Thrones: Game of Thrones' True Power - Jon\nJon Snow is currently a ruler of his own North, but not the whole of Westeros. He's the rightful ruler for a large part of the Seven Kingdoms, but it seems he is even more confused than most when it comes to how to rule over the rest of Westeros. He'd be wise to follow the example of the rest of his family.\nOn Game of Thrones, the history of the Targaryens is mixed. They moved north after Robert's Rebellion to claim their rightful claim to the Iron Throne. They never truly changed or shook off their Targaryen heritage, but they really seemed to enjoy taking on the other families as their masters. They never really bowed down to the other houses, instead bolstering their realm through war and treachery. Because of their devotion to the dragons and the East, it would seem the Targaryens had always wanted to become an upper-class family. That's especially true of Daenerys, who is the beautiful queen the Targaryens loved to marry and have children with. It took a war of human, dragon, and undead coming together to put a permanent stop to the Targaryens and their greatness.\nRelated: Game of Thrones Theory: Bran Bran Can Communicate with the Others\nFor this reason, it's hard to imagine Dany as a ruler on her own. As Stark, Jon has shown he'd be willing to accept the throne should the gods give him the chance. He'd also lead because he's just as excited to take on the lords and masters as Daenerys is. Dany's status as a Targaryen may make her the one to rule when her family is no longer needed to control the land. With this might comes the true power of Westeros. While she's not as passionate, Dany is there to rule the land.\n1 2\nStranger Things Season 3 Trailer Is Already Building To A Twist\n", "domain": "screenrant.com", "title": "Game Of Thrones: Why Jon Snow Is The Rightful Ruler Of Westeros, Not Dany", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Thomas Bacon, Padraig Cotter, Alex Leadbeater", "ind30k": 5345, "url": "https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-jon-snow-king-not-dany-why/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

their partner disagreed about doing it.\nIs tracking your child a good idea?\nMs Cantwell said children between the ages of five and 12 were the most common users of the watch, but she had also developed mobile software for older children.\n\"It allows the child to make a phone call as they would from a mobile to linked numbers, but only the number the parent approves and through the app the parent can see where the child is,\" she said.\n\"The child is able to send an SOS alert in case they need help or assistance or they feel a little uncomfortable in a situation, and it also gives you an exact location of where they are, and alerts if they leave safe areas that you've set up.\n\"A lot of the passive apps on the market will just show you the location of the phone or person, rather than more proactive monitoring and alerts.\n\"It's been particularly useful in the autism community where a child might be prone to running.\"\nBrisbane mother Christina Penrose said she purchased the watches for her two sons when they started attending different schools.\n\"We really wanted to be able to communicate with them, but we didn't want to have the phone scenario where they have that extra screen time, the possibility of cyber bullying and all that,\" she said.\nHer sons also have after school jobs and activities, and 12-year-old Josh Penrose said he liked the idea of not having to look after a mobile phone.\n\"I think the watch is great \u2026 with phones when you're playing soccer you have to put them down, but with the watches you don't have to remove them at all,\" he said.\n'If it saves one life then it's worth it': police\nQueensland police figures show nearly 16,000 children between the ages of five and 16 have been reported missing since 2016, and Detective Senior Sergeant Damien Powell said numbers had slightly increased.\n\"Mainly due to the Tiahleigh Palmer incident, and vigilance in the community, which is a good thing,\" Detective Senior Sergeant Powell said.\nMost children are found within the first 24 hours of being reported missing, and Detective Senior Sergeant Powell said the reasons for their disappearance varied.\n\"Abductions in Queensland are fortunately a very rare incident, and obviously we follow them all up to the best of our ability and investigated thoroughly, but children do go missing for a range of reasons,\" he said.\nFor children under the age of 12, he said the usual triggers were tantrums, where they chose to run away from home, or forgetfulness.\n\"Twelve to 18 \u2014 there's a whole range of reasons, including mental health, such as ADD, ADHD, autism and Asperger's, which can manifest itself in behavioural issues and also just forgetfulness, not being where they want to be, some rebellion,\" he said.\n\"Girls outnumber boys in one age group and one age group only, and that's the 14-16 year age \u2026 I can only put this down to a protective nature as parents and carers of the girls and the girls maturing faster than boys \u2026 not getting what they want, disagreements with their friends, their family and with their carers.\n\"So going missing can often be a reaction to their environment.\"\nHe said digital tracking may not be the answer for many scenarios police face daily.\n\"Anything the parent wishes to do that is helpful to them, gives them peace of mind, then we encourage it, but there is a reluctance within the community for this electronic tracking, and privacy becomes a problem,\" he said.\n\"People have to remember to have these devices with them, have it charged, so it's not the answer, but certainly if it saves one life then it's well worth it.\n\"As a general message, if anyone has concerns about the safety or welfare of someone, speak to your local police and we can make an informed decision from the information received and from our inquiries to make sure they're safe and well.\n\"We would far rather look into a missing person's report than having someone wondering if they should have done something.\"\nParents need to have the conversation with their child first\nQUT Professor in Early Childhood and Inclusive Education Susan Danby said the effect of digitally tracking a child was still an under-researched area.\n\"We know a little bit about helicopter parenting \u2026 there can be real issues with it particularly if children don't know about it, or don't agree to what's happening \u2026 that can create tensions within the family,\" she said.\n\"We live in a digital world. I remember when my child was going to school \u2026 I was torn, between this feeling of her wanting to be independent, at the same time, I was so worried about her getting home safely.\n\"This is a really big issue for parents \u2026 it's that tension between fear of what might happen to their child, alongside balancing it with their desire for their child to be happy and independent and to have feelings of accomplishment.\"\nShe said it was most important to have the discussion with the child first, and make sure they feel comfortable using a tracking device.\n\"You can understand why parents want to do this, I mean I certainly feel that as well, but it's also how you're going to use that with the child, or to talk through how you might introduce that to your child,\" she said.\n\"We can't surveil children without their knowledge, because that doesn't build a very trusting relationship.\"\nMs Cantwell agreed that the use of devices was never going to replace parental supervision, and proper safety education.\n\"We personally and within the organisation promote safety education and teaching children to define whether a situation is safe or not, trusting their gut instinct,\" she said.\n\"But what I think these devices, and certainly our TicToc Track watch does, is allow the child to feel comfortable that if they are in a situation that feels unsafe, they have a way of connecting with their parent.\"\nTopics: parenting, family-and-children, community-and-society, brisbane-4000, qld, australia\nFirst posted\n", "domain": "abc.net.au", "title": "More parents using GPS to track children but experts warn there could be consequences", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "ind30k": 8686, "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-04/digitally-tracking-kids-more-parents-use-devices/10957906", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.21807457434488636}
{"article": "Updated\nSome parents are going to unusual lengths to keep track of their children and use GPS tracking devices, as Northbridge parents confront the prospect of violent crime by former school students.\nKey points: Survey shows more than half of parents with a GPS device, up from 9 per cent in 2017\n50 per cent of children are mobile phones and more than half have access to the internet\nSome parents see tracking devices as child-proofing\nGPS monitoring devices have become widely used among parents in the years since the worldwide web made it easier for them to track their children with less effort than just telling them.\nThe gadgets come in the form of devices that can be stitched into clothes, in mobile phones or via a wireless tracking application, such as Trackr, My Tracks or Apple's tracking for its Apple Watch.\nAnd just as many families will use online apps to share personal information about their children with friends and family who might be able to gain access to some of that information.\nSo far, security analysts are divided over the efficacy of such devices as an effective deterrent against crime.\nCNET contributor Natasha Cai said more and more young people were getting on to the internet and were using mobile phones.\n\"And a lot of teenagers are on their own or surrounded by friends that all use their iPhones,\" she said.\nThis meant they were likely to go online more regularly and try to commit crime online.\nJumping from options to technologies\nJaclyn Rudd is the founder of the GPS Safety Council, a business that advocates for the safe use of GPS devices in Australia.\nShe said the devices were used by many parents because of recent media attention to incidents of child abduction and child pornography.\n\"Child safety has grown in importance,\" she said.\nShe said police, criminals and medical professionals had all begun to make GPS devices a part of their protocols.\nMost GPS devices are passive \u2014 meaning they use a built-in GPS signal which transmits a geotag of where it has been.\nThe internet-enabled tracker installed on a child's phone also has the ability to track a child's location on an iPad, a laptop or a desktop computer.\nGPS tagging, already used in children's clothes\nMs Rudd said the first GPS tracker was placed on children's clothes by Noffs in the 1990s.\n\"Parents and safety experts thought that children wouldn't use these, and it wasn't until it became widely available that this kind of wearable tracking came in to wide use,\" she said.\nShe said GPS tracking devices were now made more advanced and could be stitched into a child's clothes or easily implanted in an implant in their body.\nParents are also introducing tracking devices for children who have left home, or left for work.\nEileen Jordan owns Surf Club and Snack Shops on Sydney's North Shore and has a toddler and son aged two, both of whom live at home with her.\n\"All three of us are on Apple phones and it's on all of them,\" she said.\nMs Jordan said she only knew of three parents who did not use the Apple Watch tracking device.\nShe said the devices would help her keep her son's room locked, and to know where he was at all times.\n\"I guess it is just helping parents make the whole family safer, so no children in the house at any time,\" she said.\n\"I don't even know that they are at home.\"\nHow to keep your children safe\nHer son's three apps are very helpful, she said.\n\"My son is four and for him it is really important that I know what he is doing,\" she said.\nShe also said her son had a good understanding of how safety devices worked.\n\"If we put his iPad in the drawer it can't be taken out unless you swipe it,\" she said.\n\"If he is always locked in his room when we don't use it, that is a good sign.\"\nShe said if anything went wrong with his iPad, she or her husband would have to \"pry it open\".\nMs Jordan uses the two devices to keep herself and her children safe when the family are together.\nShe said if her son fell down a flight of stairs and could not get up, she would know where he was, even if he could not tell her.\nMs Rudd said parents needed to talk to their children and talk with their children about safety to help reduce their sense of security.\n\"I think it is very important for parents to communicate with their children,\" she said.\n\"Some children will want to be in control, and what better way of exercising control than controlling what you tell them.\"\nTopics: internet-technology, information-and-communication, children, parenting,

{"article": "I was invited to attend a conference on entrepreneurship with Cootsi, a Dubai-based start-up founded by Sahar Piracha. The three-day conference included a series of workshops, sessions and startup pitch events attended by more than 500 people. It was a memorable week. The session on innovation, entrepreneurship and data sharing was particularly exciting.\nDuring the session Sahar addressed the audience with a thought-provoking speech about women entrepreneurship and the challenges that females face in the business world. A similar speech was delivered by yet another female entrepreneur, Sabah Aziz, during which she made an attempt to urge the audience to \u201cditch the brick and screen\u201d and bring a world where women can choose to do their business outside the confines of the kitchen. The speakers also spoke on the importance of females in the startup industry, focusing on the importance of the support of their parents and understanding their motivations and ability. I left the event feeling optimistic about the possibilities for women entrepreneurs.\n\u201cStudents are developing products and services that solve real problems,\u201d said Sahar. \u201cWe want girls to develop solutions. This is what creates a startup ecosystem. The area\u2019s highlight is its accessibility, the absence of obstacles.\u201d\nThe platform features more than 300 schools across Sindh and Punjab in regions such as Rahim Yar Khan, Attock, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Lasbela, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalnagar, Karachi, Faisalabad, Jhang, and Bahawalpur. The platform also offers incentives and training to students who are interested in setting up their own business.\n\u201cWomen entrepreneurs have a lot of potential,\u201d said Sahar. \u201cYoung women look to women for education and empowerment. That\u2019s how ideas are born.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how ideas are born,\u201d said Sahar. \u201cWe have women with PhDs who are running businesses.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the global startups scene, 70% are founded by women. In emerging markets, like Africa, the figure is almost 100%,\u201d she added.\nBefore the start of the startup pitch session, another young woman presented her business concept to the audience.\n\u201cStudents are developing products and services that solve real problems,\u201d said Sahar. \u201cWe want girls to develop solutions. This is what creates a startup ecosystem. The area\u2019s highlight is its accessibility, the absence of obstacles.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that Sahar has experimented with this idea. In 2016, she created her first app called Cruder (later renamed \u2018Cruder for Good\u2019) for students at the Karachi College of Arts and Science. It is a free solution for kids to track their bag\u2019s and lunchboxes with safety warnings. It doesn\u2019t just track your bags, but also warns if there is something dangerous around the school.\n\u201cMy main point is to teach students how to be safe,\u201d Sahar said. \u201cI created the app because I wanted to start a conversation in schools. It was critical that students feel empowered to be safe.\u201d\nAfter launching the app, Sahar contacted students and demanded that they started marketing it. Their responses were quite encouraging: they wrote that they were \u201csaddened to see bags forgotten\u201d; they praised the idea of \u201cparental and user control, safety warnings, notification pop ups and other security tools\u201d; that they were \u201cunsure on how to manage the bag/lunchbox with limited information\u201d. That was enough for Sahar. She decided to monetise the app and launched it as a free service with in-app purchases.\n\u201cIf we focus on promoting an issue, it becomes an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make a positive impact in students\u2019 lives, not just educate them.\u201d\nPublished in Daily Times, April 15th 2019.\n", "domain": "dailytimes.com.pk", "title": "Crighter: A safety app from Karachi-based techie", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Fatimah Mehr", "ind30k": 9629, "url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/376649/crighter-a-safety-app-from-karachi-based-techie/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made it clear that the United States is not in Afghanistan to rebuild the nation or teach Afghans how to deal with their women.\nThe secretary's remarks came during two days of congressional hearings this week on the US State Department\u2019s budget proposals.\n\u201cRemember, the Afghans will ultimately decide,\u201d said the top US diplomat when Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, urged him to ensure that the agreement between the US and the Taliban protects the rights of the Afghan women.\nExamine: 'We never want to go back': Afghan women fear cost of peace under Taliban\n\u201cI hope they (Afghan women) will make their voices heard \u2026 I hope the women of Afghanistan will demand that of their leadership,\u201d he said.\n\"We want every woman's voice to be heard [...] I hope they'll all do that.\"\nDuring the two-day discussions, Secretary Pompeo explained the purpose behind talks with the Afghan Taliban. The US is talking to the Afghan Taliban because they control \"significant resources\" in Afghanistan, he said.\nMeanwhile, senior lawmakers explained why Washington must leave the war-ravaged country now. Even those who criticised the administration\u2019s Afghan policy said they too wanted a withdrawal but in a more orderly fashion.\nReminding the chief American diplomat that the US has been at war in Afghanistan for 18 years, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said: \u201cI think even you have admitted there's no military solution to Afghanistan. It's a mess. It's nation-building at its worst. The president, like myself, complains endlessly about the $50 billion we are wasting there every year.\u201d\nSenator Shaheen questioned the wisdom behind the Trump administration\u2019s decision to hold direct talks with the Taliban, pointing out that despite the talks, the insurgents had continued their attacks on both US and Afghan government forces and were also refusing to hold direct talks with Kabul.\nUS-Taliban talks: As hopes rise of a deal, what comes next?\nThe US has already held six rounds of talks with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, and is preparing for the next round later this month, which may also include representatives of the Afghan government as members of a larger Afghan delegation.\n\u201cWith respect to why we are talking to the Taliban, they control a significant amount of resources. And to get the reconciliation we need, to take down the violence level, the Taliban are going to have a say,\u201d Secretary Pompeo said.\n\u201cWe have extensive daily conversations,\u201d the secretary said when the senator asked why the Afghan government was kept out of the talks.\n\u201cBut they are not on the table,\u201d Senator Shaheen interjected.\n\u201cTo the extent that the negotiations are taking place, they are as much part of the table as anybody else. We are talking with the National Unity Government and speaking with the Taliban,\u201d Pompeo responded.\n\u201cWe are working to get the two of them in the room together. We think we are closer than we have been anytime in the last decade in achieving that. This will ultimately be a resolution that the Afghan people will have to achieve.\u201d\nSenator Shaheen interrupted him and asked: \u201cWhy do we believe the Taliban would be honest with us anymore today than they have been in the last 17 years?\u201d\n\u201cTrust, but verify. It will be about actions on the ground,\u201d said the secretary while explaining the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the talks.\nAlso read: Taliban say they are not looking to rule Afghanistan alone\nPompeo acknowledged that \u201cdistrust\u201d was a major problem in the Afghan peace process \u2014 the distrust between the US and Taliban and in dealings with other actors.\n\u201cWe understand that there's not only a deep level of distrust with the Taliban, [but] there is a deep level of distrust with many of the actors in the Afghan area. It's a nation that has a sad history with respect to truth-telling and corruption. We have our eyes wide open.\u201d\nThe US, he said, was looking for an agreement that leads to reconciliation and takes down the violence level. The negotiations will get a framework but actions on the ground will ultimately deliver the confidence needed to end this conflict, he added.\nSecretary Pompeo said Washington was focused on two major points: reducing the waste of US resources and risks to American soldiers and to prevent future terrorist attacks \u201cfrom that real estate\u201d.\n", "domain": "dawn.com", "title": "US not in Afghanistan to rebuild the nation, says Pompeo", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Anwar Iqbal, Gordon D.

{"article": "CYPRESS, Kaysville \u2014 Never has a guest lectured about the Senate from the place in which the bills become law.\nSenate President Stuart Adams did just that to 30 sixth-graders Tuesday, discussing issues as diverse as juvenile justice and hate crimes and explaining the role of the Senate.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more proud to be in public service than I do today,\u201d Adams said, referring to a new civics lesson his wife Cathy Adams submitted to the State Office of Education.\n\"Our kids are ready to join the Senate,\" he said.\nAdams, the longest-serving senator in the Senate, reflected on recent accomplishments he was proud of, including the increasing graduation rate from 50 percent in 2014 to 71 percent last year. He said he is particularly proud of Utah's work to address some of the problems faced by child molesters, crimes that range from forcible sodomy to rape.\n\"Every time I have a conference room, there\u2019s somebody there who has been hurt by someone who is a sexual offender,\u201d he said.\nAdams, who has a teenage son, told the students he has never found a better time to be part of the Utah Legislature.\n\"It feels like our Legislature has finally gotten back to its roots,\" he said.\nSen. Wayne Harper, R-Taylorsville, and Rep. Francis Gibson, R-Mapleton, also spoke to the students Tuesday at Kaysville Elementary.\nCathy Adams said her husband's primary goal in public service has been to help improve the lives of the average citizen and make a difference.\n\"He views himself as an average person, he doesn't see himself as a public servant. As a public servant, he always wants to help people,\" she said.\nThat interests schoolchildren, she said.\nAdams has served as lieutenant governor, secretary of labor, treasurer, registrar of voters and chief executive officer of the Davis School District.\nHe joked that he has \"seen some of the saddest and darkest days of our state\" and never thought about what he would tell the students if he had the opportunity to write them a letter.\nThe students wrote him a note on Post-it notes, sometimes a suggestion for a change in policy, sometimes a complaint about something done by the school.\nInclude me, write me a letter, Adams responded, signing his note \"Your Utah Sen.\"\nBecause of the tragedy of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, one student asked Adams to meet with school leaders and recommend ways to prevent students from having to see violence in public schools.\n\"Get to the bottom of why we can't protect our kids,\" he said.\nIn one of a series of Kaysville fifth-graders, \"Milkie\" is struck with the effect of guns when he looks up and sees a real gun pointed at him.\n\"It's just so scary,\" he said.\nThen, when the Senate president expressed concern about his concerns about public school safety, Milkie asked, \"Can I tell you that these experiences with the guns scared me?\"\n\"You should. They don't scare me.

{"article": "Before I started to study marine environmental science, I worked in restaurants for a while. As a server, I remember cleaning out large aquariums filled with cobia and mullet.\nFor this post, we discussed issues you\u2019re worried about, both in the food you eat and the marine life around you. If you\u2019re thinking about ways to help the creatures of the sea, start by browsing the Environmental Media Association\u2019s \u201cEco Guide to Eating Seafood\u201d and take our quiz about your seafood\u2019s source, which is shared on the EMA website.\nQuestion 1: how much seafood are you eating?\nAnswer: based on my work experience, I mostly eat from the fish market, using the same restaurant, grocery and grocery store items. I find them convenient and cheap. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a large backyard where I often go fishing to catch my own fish. I love their health and taste \u2014 and I try to minimize the impact of fish consumption on the environment and on wildlife.\nQuestion 2: Does your food come from a direct source of life or from a middle party?\nAnswer: I avoid the use of trucks, airplanes, water-skis and other underwater vehicles that transport seafoods. Like everyone else, I purchase fish caught from a single sustainable source \u2014 in my case, a fish farm in Hawaii. I typically use larger cutup fish, especially mackerel, instead of chopped raw white fish. Finally, I try to do everything possible to make sure the \u201cfarming\u201d and \u201ccapturing\u201d methods are sustainable and that it\u2019s not having an impact on the fishery and local ecosystem.\nQuestion 3: How often do you consume seafood?\nAnswer: I try to eat seafood about every two to three weeks. I rarely eat it when I\u2019m away from home or when travelling to an island or city away from my family.\nQuestion 4: Can you change your habits to help marine life?\nAnswer: The ocean provides a unique opportunity for us to do our part to help animals, including the endangered bluefin tuna and lobster. We all have a role to play: fishermen and the coastal communities where they catch and sell their catch; diners who care about the provenance of their food and shop fishmongers who source from high-quality fish farms in protected areas.\nIf you\u2019re worried about your consumption habits, take the Environment Canada questionnaire about ocean fish caught close to shore and our poll on the following page, and we hope you\u2019ll find these resources inspiring.\nWe\u2019ve also shared our answers to questions about how we approach seafood: fish farming, how much freshwater we use and how we use our energy.

{"article": "Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on Capitol Hill on Feb. 8. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\nHouse Democrats are reportedly considering whether to boot Rep. Ilhan Omar from her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee for allegedly making anti-Semitic remarks. The sharp divisions of party-wide opinion on the issue were encapsulated last week when party leaders announced that Speaker Nancy Pelosi would not retaliate against Omar for calling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s support for Israel in an op-ed \u201cpatently racist.\u201d On Saturday, Politico reported that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, asked GOP conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., to rescind her invitation to the U.S.-Israel Intergovernmental Affairs Committee retreat.\nWe\u2019re still not sure if this stuff was genuine or fake. While many Democrats, like Rep. Keith Ellison, have called on House leaders to discipline Omar, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has refused. Here are three possible reactions, the three scenarios that suggest the most lopsided party-line reactions:\n1. All Democrats are wrong. The Dems\u2019 real goal seems to be continuing to condemn anti-Semitism without actually challenging the anti-Semites. Though it would be relatively easy to imagine a series of votes condemning anti-Semitism that would eventually nudge the party toward some sort of compromise, it\u2019s possible that some Democrats will just continue to issue condemnations anyway.\n2. Some Democrats are right and some are wrong. There\u2019s some reason to believe Pelosi will change course and condemn Omar in her own way, perhaps by using her leadership position to pressure the rest of the party to accept the result of a well-received cultural-softening vote.\n3. Pelosi cares less about views than unity. There\u2019s also a chance that Pelosi would oppose Omar\u2019s punishment if it affects the party\u2019s appeal. Omar would likely have a better chance of getting reprimanded in a post-shove it world than she does in one as alarmed by the rising tide of anti-Semitism as House Democrats are right now.

He was issued a $158.08 tow fee notice for the second towing, but said police never allowed him to get his car back, according to the Broward County court records.\nAs a result, a civil case was filed last month against Monsur for ignoring the expired notice.\n\"The city is relying on the police department for enforcement of the law and we do not have the right or authority to stop a tow.

{"article": "Syracuse, N.Y. \u2013 Incoming Syracuse freshman Brycen Goodine isn\u2019t sure what position he\u2019ll be asked to play when he joins the Orange next season. But he\u2019s spent the year trying to become as versatile as possible, attempting to maximize his opportunity for immediate playing time.\nSyracuse needs to replace both of its starting guards and Goodine, who is 6-foot-4, played both point guard and shooting guard for St. Andrew\u2019s School (Barrington, R.I.) as a post graduate this past year. His biggest focus was attempting to add floor general abilities to his natural scoring skills.\nHe did it well enough to lift St. Andrew\u2019s to its first NEPSAC Class AA title since 2007 and win the league\u2019s Player of the Year Award, averaging 21.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game.\n\u201cRight now he\u2019s a combo guard,\u201d St. Andrew\u2019s coach Mike Hart said. \u201cLast year he was a two-guard. We\u2019ve got him halfway there. As he adds some leadership skills and some vocalness, you\u2019ll see him handling the ball and being that long, tall point guard. Kind of like how Jason Hart played but more of a shooter.\u201d\nGoodine\u2019s introduction to Syracuse came from television. His grandmother loved the Orange. During one game, his uncle suggested he should play like Michael Carter-Williams, whose path he has followed closely to this point.\nBoth were lanky combination guards who grew up in New England and played for Hart at St. Andrew\u2019s. Goodine\u2019s mother now coaches with the AAU program started by Carter-Williams and his family.\nStill, he views himself as a different style of player than Carter-Williams, who impressively played point guard for the Orange and is now a member of the NBA\u2019s Orlando Magic.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of a point guard,\u201d Goodine said of Carter-Williams. \u201cI want to be more of a shooter. (Syracuse) likes taller point guards that can push and run. That\u2019s how I fit in (at point guard). I didn\u2019t want to pick a school that had a system, like, for example, Providence, where the system is (based on feeding) the big. If you\u2019re a guard at Syracuse the coaching staff is all point guards. That\u2019s better for me in the long run.\u201d\nTwo coaches whose teams played against St. Andrew\u2019s multiple times over the past two seasons agreed that Goodine\u2019s best attribute is his ability to score, something he does through a combination of strong shooting and high-level athleticism.\nGoodine\u2019s initial love of basketball stemmed from dunking. He has a vertical leap of around 40 inches and will compete in the dunk contest at American Family Insurance High School Slam Dunk in Minneapolis on Friday. The event is part of a weekend of activities surrounding the Final Four. Syracuse fans looking to get a glimpse of Goodine\u2019s leaping ability can watch a replay of the contest at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday on CBS.\nIn addition to athleticism, though, Goodine also owns the school record for 3-pointers in a single season at St. Andrew\u2019s, a noted prep school where former Syracuse player Demetris Nichols also played. Goodine has a smooth shooting stroke from distance.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a true scorer,\u201d said James Cormier, a former Le Moyne player and the head coach at Cushing Academy, which lost 84-72 in to St. Andrew\u2019s in the Class AA championship game. \u201cHe can score at all three levels. He\u2019s got a good pull-up game. He shoots the 3 at a high clip. He\u2019s really athletic so he can finish at the rim. He has a lot of ability to score the ball, that\u2019s for sure. He\u2019s got a better IQ than he gets credit for. He plays within himself.\u201d\n\u201cWe played him twice last year,\u201d said Marcus O\u2019Neil, the head coach at the Tilton School. \u201cWe played him twice this year. The best thing about him is this: I don\u2019t have to play him twice next year. He\u2019s athletic and he can shoot the ball from pretty deep. He\u2019s got a lot of upside. The league has a lot of good teams and a lot of good players, but he\u2019s someone you remember going against. I have no idea what that means at the next level, but he\u2019s a great player.\u201d\nWhile Goodine was often more comfortable allowing teammates to run the offense, he displayed a knack for smart basketball and good passing skills. The ball rarely stuck in his hands and his ability to involve a talented post player was a key to St. Andrew\u2019s success.\nWith Goodine making entry passes from the same side of the floor as Colgate-bound Keegan Records, St. Andrew\u2019s opponents couldn\u2019t double-team either one and found themselves in a bind.\nStill, Goodine, ranked as the No. 94 prospect in the country by 247 Sports, acknowledges he needs to continue to develop as a point guard if he wants to contribute at both positions in college, a process that must continue even as he prepares for his first college season.\nHe is quiet by nature \u2013 an oral communications class at St. Andrew\u2019s has helped \u2013 and he and Hart have had dedicated conversations devoted to leadership skills. While both Goodine and Hart considered the transition to point guard a work in progress during the season, it all came together well enough for Goodine to help St. Andrew\u2019s win one of the toughest high school titles in the country.\n\u201cI\u2019m still working on being vocal, my strength, my decision-making as a point guard,\u201d Goodine said. \u201cI could play a little better defense, too. My defense isn\u2019t terrible. But one of my goals is to get better.\u201d\n\u201cMost guys have to work on ball-handling, defense, their vertical or 3-point shooting,\u201d Hart said. \"He has to work on leadership skills, how to motivate people that need to be yelled at and how to be kind to motivate others that need that. That\u2019s the challenge for him, which is weird and deep. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. He needs to develop those skills so that he can play point guard in college. That\u2019s doable. But that\u2019s the difference between him playing point guard or off-guard. If he wants minutes at Syracuse he\u2019s going to have to play some point. He\u2019s aware of that.\u201d\nBoth opposing coaches said that when they played St. Andrew\u2019s this season, Goodine spent more time playing shooting guard than point guard.\nSYR Incoming Syracuse freshman Brycen Goodine is still looking to add strength and would like to add 20 pounds by the end of his freshman season. (Photo submitted to Syracuse.com)\n\u201cHe played off the ball a lot,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a combo guard. He can play either one. It depends who you have him out there with.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t label him a true point guard,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a kid that sees the floor well.\u201d\nGoodine thought his skill set would mesh nicely with the approach Syracuse used last season, which had Tyus Battle and Frank Howard share ball-handling duties and a rotation of initiating the offense.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really have set positions,\u201d Goodine said. \u201cEveryone is sort of a combo guard. Everyone is 6-4 and up.\u201d\nO\u2019Neil said he often tries to stop an opposing team\u2019s best threat by face-guarding them with an average defender, giving his player just one job and telling them not to provide any help defense. Against Goodine, he upped the level of difficulty by using his best defender. He still wasn\u2019t able to stop Goodine.\nCormier said he mixed defenses and tried to use different types of defenders. While he thought Cushing was successful keeping Goodine out of the paint, it wasn\u2019t enough to stop him.\nGoodine was able to hit difficult shots over Daman Tate, a 6-foot-5 wing. Against Bensley Joseph, a 6-foot-1 guard whose quickness bothered many guards that Cushing played, Goodine was able to use his height advantage to elevate and knock down shots.\nBoth defenders are likely Division I players. Tate committed to Boston University on Monday night. Joseph has offers from Iowa and Rutgers.\n\u201cHe torched us,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cLast year in the semifinals he killed us. Then this year we actually did a good job keeping him out of the paint. But he\u2019s a high IQ guy. He was able to take advantage. He buried a lot of shots early (in the) first game. Then he did a little bit of everything in the championship (game). He made the big plays when they needed him.\u201d\nSyracuse has Jalen Carey and Howard Washington returning as point guards, although both will be inexperienced at the college level entering next season. Shooting guard Buddy Boeheim saw substantial minutes off the bench as a reserve and improved markedly as the year went on. The Orange will also be adding Joe Girard III, another combination guard.\nGoodine hopes to put himself in the mix at both spots and, regardless of position, he anticipates being called on immediately.\n\u201cThey want me to play (right away),\u201d Goodine said. \u201cIt just depends on how hard I work. It\u2019s not going to be easy at all. I have a lot to do, even to just play. One little mistake and you\u2019re on the bench. A turnover and you\u2019re on the bench. You can\u2019t give them any excuses. Nothing is handed to you up there.\u201d\nGoodine remains thin, and he\u2019ll want to add strength over the course of his college career. He weighs 175 pounds and acknowledges that he would like to add about 20 pounds by the time he finishes his freshman season.\nHe does scheduled weight-lifting with his teammates at St. Andrew\u2019s and he\u2019s been given a packet by Syracuse detailing the strength and conditioning expectations when he arrives on campus. To add weight, though, he feels he\u2019d have to devote additional time to lifting and, at least for now, he prefers to spend his spare time working on skills more than strength.\n\u201cI asked Coach (Jim) Boeheim what can I work on and he said, \u2018Well, you can never shoot too much.\u2019 \u201d Goodine said. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to work on my body when I get there. The most important thing for me is my jump shot. I love shooting 3s, love shooting 3s.\u201d\nContact Chris Carlson anytime: E-mail | Twitter | 315-412-1639\nFollow Syracuse basketball on Twitter and Facebook\n", "domain": "syracuse.com", "title": "How will Brycen Goodine fit into Syracuse basketball\u2019s backcourt in 2019-20?", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Chris Carlson", "ind30k": 6161, "url": "https://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2019/04/how-will-brycen-goodine-fit-into-syracuse-basketballs-backcourt-in-2019-20.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.23477092048240986}
{"article": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- As recently as the beginning of this season, a group of Syracuse basketball fans shared their excitement about Brycen Goodine as a returner.\nThe redshirt sophomore missed nearly the entire 2015-16 season due to an undisclosed issue, but despite undergoing treatment, impressed people in practice and was an active member of the Syracuse basketball community. He was set to make his return.\nBut the highly-touted Syracuse guard will spend the entire 2017-18 season at Arkansas State on scholarship.\nAfter an NCAA ruling in January, Orange coach Jim Boeheim admitted the season had been a \u201crebuilding season\u201d for Goodine. He noted that Goodine\u2019s knee was still healing.\n\u201cHe had surgery this year to fix his knee,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably going to redshirt. He\u2019s not quite ready to play.\u201d\nGoodine still felt it was worth returning for his redshirt season, which made Tuesday\u2019s announcement all the more confusing.\nThere are three reasons to imagine this being somewhat of a difficult situation for the Syracuse staff.\n1. Goodine wasn\u2019t only promised a redshirt, he was conditioned by the coaches and fans to come back this season. It would seem odd for the team to then change its mind and choose not to bring him back at all.\n2. The Orange staff may be right. Goodine is a lot closer to being healthy than when he was at full strength. He\u2019s still making progress, making it harder to come back.\n3. While things may have gotten more difficult for Goodine in his rehab, the staff is still recovering. All things considered, and considering a diagnosis for what caused Goodine\u2019s issue, this is probably the best time for Goodine to move on.\nAs a former four-star recruit who spent a considerable amount of time at SU out of high school, it\u2019s unlikely that Goodine\u2019s recruitment for 2019-20 is very far along. He could come out of his redshirt season and make the decision whether to return at some point this spring.\nMeanwhile, Syracuse is recruiting two guards out of high school, including Omar Samhan, a 6-foot-2, 175-pound guard from Lake Forest Academy in Forest, Ill.\nSamhan was courted heavily during the 2018-19 season and attended Syracuse\u2019s open gyms. He is someone who could end up competing with Goodine for playing time.\nContact Chris Carlson anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-412-1639.\nDunks and dives: Here are the best dunks and dives at Syracuse basketball's spring workout\n", "domain": "syracuse.com", "title": "How will Brycen Goodine fit into Syracuse basketball\u2019s backcourt in 2019-20?", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Chris Carlson", "ind30k": 6161, "url": "https://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2019/04/how-will-brycen-goodine-fit-into-syracuse-basketballs-backcourt-in-2019-20.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "analysis\nIn 2013, The Times of South Africa highlighted concerns about the pressure on white rhinos in a clear, straightforward and well-informed editorial. In 2018, in a letter to a friend, I voiced similar concerns to argue against restricting the number of poached black rhinos. The former expressed its views as environmentalist and the latter, as an opponent of animal rights groups.\nAt the time, I focused on poaching as a possible environmental disaster to which government, NGOs and the media collectively failed to respond. Now, in 2019, that view has been augmented and justified by crime statistics that confirm the worst fears of most responsible people: poaching is a looming crisis.\nNamibia has the highest population of rhinos of any sub-region in the world. Its 150,000 rhinos provide the subsistence income of up to 200,000 families. Conservation efforts have effectively ridding black rhinos of violence and organised crime in the northern part of the country, where attacks have become a chronic problem. But the rhino numbers are at risk of falling.\nWildlife management is increasingly threatened by the rapid depletion of animals, and successive governments have spent huge amounts of money on unsuccessful man-made solutions to global climate change. Meanwhile wildlife crime continues to be an invisible public health crisis.\nExpanding ambitions\nNamibia has been making its ambitions in the sector even clearer of late. Plans for expanding the current rhino and elephant populations as well as damming areas of the Etosha National Park are now the focus of conservation activities in the country.\nIn 2018, this worked in concert with tourism interests to restrict black rhino numbers to just nine. Wildlife crime is now seen as \"not enough\" in Namibia when compared to other priority species.\nAs the international outcry against poaching declines, there's growing recognition of the need to do more, both in a technical and a pragmatic sense. This should include providing much-needed support for the security forces in managing the situation.\nThe mainstay of this is the introduction of more effective forensic technology. This would build on the nationwide system of DNA labs which, through the resourcing of animal crime units, are at last beginning to bridge the gap between capture and conviction.\nIt would also work towards improving the training of the police and the courts in what should be limited to purely forensic matters. But most of all, the technology needs to be usable by the animal control agencies and user communities, as well as those working in the forest.\nA very big challenge for the country is dealing with poaching in rural communities. Engaging these communities at both policy and policy implementation levels is vital. But here again technology and expertise are sorely needed.\nThe small but growing number of African elephants have similar problems of poachers using high-tech devices to manipulate them to greater capacities of growth and reproduction. There is therefore the need for a multidisciplinary response to this threat which considers the nature of the population in question and considers such animals' vulnerability and infrastructural needs.\nBut not everything should be done by the elephants or rhinos or the game personnel. Food sovereignty is another critical element of rural conflict policy. And this demands coordination and collaboration within policy frameworks at national, regional and, most important, sub-regional levels.\nAn effective response to wildlife crime requires cooperation between people, arms and the state. Of course this involves realising the breadth of responsibilities shared by the many agencies involved in wildlife management. Only then will each organisation be in a position to take a holistic approach, involving the wider community and public as well as multi-disciplinary and multi-organised efforts.\nOnly then will local, regional and national authorities be able to implement wildlife policies and laws with effective impact. Their work must also involve effective surveillance and monitoring.\nThis will require collaboration with people and governments in neighbouring countries. This may require effective mechanisms of sharing intelligence and information, building capacity, strengthening legal and enforcement procedures, streamlining customs and other procedures, and adapting laws to technological developments, including chemical immobilisation of animals.\nThis is an integrated and holistic approach, as we have seen in the overall planning for the Namibian rhino population, and to issues with commercial enterprises, including production and export of rhino horn.\nIt will also require supporting the management of large animals within biodiversity zones - including indigenous flora and fauna. And conservation will need to be seen to serve all uses, including the furtherance of cultural and spiritual values as well as economic development.\n", "domain": "allafrica.com", "title": "South Africa: Competing Conservation Ideologies - Troubled Times for Reporting On Namibian Wildlife", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Liz Rihoy, Malan Lindeque", "ind30k": 7498, "url": "https://allafrica.com/stories/201904150065.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

But officials reportedly remain unsure of their next move.\nThe role of the department\u2019s chief executive has also been put into question, as Louise Bond, the managing director of the private company from which the government is looking to hire as contractor, Keppel Prince, left with little fanfare this week.\nBond is believed to have led the recruitment process, which will see the organisation once again rent space from another party, but it remains unclear what the company\u2019s duties will be, and whether or not it will be acting alone, despite being a government contractor.\nQ&A: Sean Dorney reflects on the asylum seeker debate Read more\nThe role of the department\u2019s director general, immigration Duncan Lewis, who oversaw the brutal shackling of asylum seekers at sea, also remains unclear, although one of the leaked emails from the private detention facility management company, Icepig, suggests that it was he who was personally responsible for the conditions inside detention centres.\nSimon Bolt and Angus Micallef asked the government in question time about their policy on Dr Ley\u2019s proposals, the division where she resigned from federal politics, and whether or not they would review offshore processing as a part of their campaign.\nTurnbull stopped short of calling a halt to the process, and cited a commitment to ensuring medical care and responses to disasters as being the highest priority, but noted the government was working to resolve the humanitarian health crisis in the Christmas Island detention centre.\n\u201cThe situation is actually very different, it is not as serious,\u201d Turnbull said.\n\u201cObviously we do not want to see people in a state of agony who are our people, our fellow Australians, suffering under these conditions.\n\u201cNo responsible government should be doing that and I am determined that we will take every step we can to find a solution to the humanitarian circumstances of our people, so that these people who need our help, who will one day leave the detention centre but at the moment need our help to have a life of dignity and human rights, can have that, and that is what we are trying to do.\u201d\nLabor challenged Turnbull to clarify whether or not he would address all of the ministers, including her replacement, Peter Dutton, whose view that detainees should be shackled was strongly endorsed by the premier of the NT, Michael Gunner.\nLiberal backbencher Danielle Green also criticised the Abbott government, saying it was no longer believable that Australian government was treating people in this manner.\nGreen questioned the government\u2019s intention to detain people further in Christmas Island and suggested the government needed to do a re-think.\nThe government is currently selling off its offshore processing assets under the offshore processing leases held by IHMS, Icepig and G4S.\nIt has promised to create a new model to deal with those in immigration detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru and would seek to increase incentives for people to return to their home countries.\nThe government is also putting together a group to develop a plan to remove children from detention centres and will make decisions on medical transfers to Australia \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d.\n", "domain": "theguardian.com", "title": "Coalition's visa privatisation plan believed dead \u2013 at least until after election", "date": "April 05, 2019", "authors": "Amy Remeikis", "ind30k": 9130, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/05/coalitions-visa-privatisation-plan-believed-dead-at-least-until-after-election", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n[WARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Captain Marvel.]\n-\nWhile Captain Marvel will form the most crucial part of the Avengers' defeat of Thanos, it'll be MCU audiences who are left with the prize. Marvel Studios recently confirmed the release date for Avengers: Endgame would be May 3, and leaked images featuring the promotional art for the movie have already revealed it will feature Captain Marvel as the hero facing the Mad Titan.\nThe audience knows Captain Marvel will feature heavily in Endgame because she's the only MCU character whose origin was confirmed in the marketing. From Thor: Ragnarok's post-credits scene to Avengers: Infinity War's post-credits scene, Marvel has depicted a host of heroes visiting Earth to find out what happened to the surviving heroes as well as the alien villain - some of which have their own histories - but Captain Marvel's is the one comic book hero not revealed in the marketing. It was simply hinted at. Marvel also has set up a pretty major role for Captain Marvel in Avengers: Endgame's marketing as well, and it just might be more important than anyone is admitting.\nRelated: Disney's 2019 Release Schedule: Every Marvel Movie Coming In 2019\nSo, while Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) will be the hero going up against Thanos (Josh Brolin) and getting the Infinity Gauntlet back in Avengers: Endgame, her power level and abilities are very different to the other Avengers. In a way, her past and potential future impact Endgame the most. For now, however, here are 10 things Captain Marvel can do to defeat Thanos in Avengers: Endgame.\n9. Invisibility\nIf nothing else, Captain Marvel can disappear. Not in the typical ghostly sense of the term, but in that state of near-invisibility. Take a look at the trailers for Captain Marvel, or any of the Endgame marketing. If Captain Marvel is able to turn her flight suit's wings into wings that nobody else can see, it's a pretty impressive trick. Similarly, if Captain Marvel can see in zero gravity, with no reference in the trailer, it's going to be an incredible skill.\nAs opposed to other heroes like the Hulk or the Scarlet Witch, Captain Marvel doesn't have to be able to see through walls or to bend solid objects to her will, which is why she can become invisible. This, in fact, may be the reason why Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury was able to contact Carol Danvers before the final battle with Thanos. With a more superior disguise than Fury could have concocted, Captain Marvel can essentially blind-spot those who would oppose her - while including the individuals she saves.\n", "domain": "screenrant.com", "title": "10 Powers Captain Marvel Can Use To Defeat Thanos in Avengers: Endgame", "date": "April 10, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 1496, "url": "https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-powers-thanos-endgame/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Founders Fund and Starbucks both believe that with each transaction a city grows richer as we provide opportunities for local business owners, teach them about the business of coffee and give them the needed tools to expand and improve.\"\nThis is a big bet for Starbucks and it shows that the company still believes that single-cup brewers are viable in the marketplace -- at least, for a while.\nWhat is Starbucks Express?\nThe Starbucks Express will offer up a variety of coffee-focused snacks and drinks, with the company saying that a Starbucks pour-over will cost $3.75 and a small espresso at $2.25. These will be hand-crafted specialty drinks, from a cappuccino to a smoothie to an espresso with soup to a sandwich. Many of the food items, which will be mostly prepared by retail employees, will have customizable options and baked goods.\nStarbucks is also launching a marketing campaign for the cafes, which will initially go into New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. that will serve as a real-world test of its technology and home-kitchen efficiency. Customers will be able to order their drinks on Starbucks' mobile app and pick them up at Starbucks Express locations.\nThough it's not clear when these will launch, the experiment is likely to be successful given that the Starbucks brand is still so big, at least in big cities, that it can still command significant foot traffic regardless of whether Starbucks is present in a location. In New York City, for example, it has about 600 stores.\nWhy is Starbucks doing this?\nThough this isn't a huge move, it's a significant one. Starbucks and Starbucks Express will both see substantial marketing support, which should increase the likelihood that the new initiative will succeed in its initial test.\nAlthough the retail business has been hurting, home-entertainment products are apparently succeeding, as companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others have found with streaming media players.\nStarbucks has long employed a disruptive strategy that, like Apple's, tries to gain market share rather than make money. The company has allowed other Starbucks locations to serve as a test lab where it can learn from local customers and tweak its offerings. This new initiative builds on that and puts the company at the forefront of an interesting new business model.\nWhile this is not a huge deal, it's a well-timed and necessary move that makes sense from a marketing perspective.\n", "domain": "fool.com", "title": "Starbucks Places a $100 Million Bet on Start-Ups -- The Motley Fool", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Daniel B.

They need a different voice,\u201d Kenney said.\nClark said he is standing up for people left behind in the global economy.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing that we\u2019re part of the problem, we\u2019re not part of the solution,\u201d he said.\nClark said the province also needs to deliver more money to frontline services like child care and health care.\nSwellan said he is confident that he has broad support among voters who want to see more political choices.\n\u201cThe success of the Liberals will be based on how many people step up and vote on election day. \u2026 It\u2019s not going to be enough to just demonstrate that there\u2019s another way to vote,\u201d he said.\nGreen Leader Sonia Furstenau and the NDP\u2019s Michelle Stilwell also took part in the debate.\nHOSTILE STYLE\nClark was booed during the debate for speaking freely about social issues, including illegal fentanyl and unvaccinated children.\nDuring the taping Monday of the debate, Clark called for debate about a video of a supporter at an Edmonton rally attacking the off-limits topic of Indigenous rights.\nThe protester, taken down by an observer, went on to explain that Indigenous cultures are in crisis because of the acceptance of \u201cwhite\u201d Christianity.\nClark said Tuesday that it is \u201cthe anthem of racism and its dominance in Alberta.\u201d\nSWANSON HAS ENDORSEMENT\nSwann said Tuesday that the Alberta Party has received his endorsement in the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\nSwann said the endorsement is not to be confused with the support of former Tory MLA Donna Kennedy-Glans, who returned to the Progressive Conservative fold and has held back from endorsing either party.\nSwann praised Clark for \u201ca wonderful campaign\u201d and said it\u2019s \u201ca pleasure\u201d to have him as a leader.\nSAUSAGE SLAGGER\nThe Alberta Liberals, who have made animal protection a major platform issue in the election, threw their support behind the Alberta Party after it drew fire for a signature campaign.\nSwann said the pledge to phase out the use of factory farms by 2025 is good on the health and welfare of animals.\nHe said it\u2019s also an example of the party standing up for the environment and reducing obesity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to take some chances,\u201d he said.\nBut Clark\u2019s vow to create 100,000 jobs in Alberta, put $50 million into the province\u2019s agriculture sector and cancel four projects at oilsands pipeline companies drew criticism.\nThe agreement doesn\u2019t include any new policy promises.

Thor, in a state of financial ruin, is still cleaning up the mess after defeating Hela. As a recovering man without hope, he cannot go back to his home, which is now in the hands of the Valkyrie. Thor finally finds the only home he has ever known, but as Valkyrie is about to take him to Asgard, his protective pet Ghost inexplicably shows up. As Valkyrie leaves, Ghost takes control of her and they engage in a fierce battle that sees Valkyrie brutally beaten by the homicidal prisoner. Thor then beats Ghost to a pulp and kills the lovable creature.\nThese words are uttered by Thor as he looks at the skeleton of his lover Jane Foster. If these words are to be believed, this is the most painful moment we have seen in his Thor films to date.\n\"Why have you failed all these generations when I will never fail?\"\n2. \"Let the day end.\"\nIn Thor: Ragnarok, Thor pays tribute to the force of nature that is Surtur by blasting the fiery and destructive storm over Asgard. When Thor discovers that the whole city is hidden behind what is in essence the glowing mass of fire, he calls for help. The thunder god is only able to get to the city through the mercy of Grandmaster's Golden Gun. We see a vision of the catastrophic climax that the Asgardians are about to face in the aftermath of the war. He watches all of Asgard be destroyed and falls silent. The fire thunder god isn't doing well in his new role of one-man army.\nThe sound of Surtur raging in the distance gives him an upbeat moment, but even that is only a small beginning of the end. As Surtur burns, Thor realizes what lies ahead and realizes that nothing good will ever come of this relationship. As his brother Loki stands by, waiting for their destiny to play out, Thor comments, \"Let the day end.\"\n\"Let the day end.\"\n3. \"There will never be a satisfying conclusion.\"\nWhen the Doctor Strange and Wong are searching for Thor after he has traveled to interdimensional realms and encountered numerous fallen heroes (in this particular instance his brother Loki, and an Avengers that currently includes Iron Man, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Captain America). Wong tells Strange that there is a part of Thor's being that knows that his journey is about to play out in a way that will not be satisfying for anyone.

Check with LADWP.\nIt\u2019s too bad the federal tax credit is dropping from $7,500 to about half that for most carmakers. But that is just a credit applied to what you owe in taxes. Some may owe nothing so its not applicable.

That is holding back folks from buying who still want to make that drive to Santa Barbara or Palm Springs.\nThe problem is in multi-family dwellings. Many rebates are offered for residential customers. For example, SCE will pay you $1,500 toward the cost of Level 2 (240-volt) home charger. Pasadena Water and Power is offering up to $6,000. Glendale Water and Power gives $500 or $2,000 for a commercial site.\nBut getting the apartment owner or condo complex HOA to install electric chargers is much, much harder.\nAbout 3,800 people in Glendale have applied for state rebates since 2011, said Herbert Garcia, GWP\u2019s marketing manager at a meeting in March. Glendale is working on adding four more public chargers in the next month. Also, the city is looking into installing curbside chargers near apartment complexes. Pasadena and Tesla will add 44 chargers in one place by the end of this year.\nMore EV notes\nThe gifts keep coming .

{"article": "Many districts and counties even without schools do not follow uniform law.\nFor the good of our school system, I urge parents to educate themselves on the issues affecting our students.\nBy DAKAR GUYO\nMore by this Author\nAs the deadline for schools across the country to select candidates for this year\u2019s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam looms, I am a little worried.\nI recall when I started my secondary school education in Kisii as a teenager and being among the first set of students at the new primary school.\nI can remember us suffering from hungry as they struggled to cook for us because the school kitchen didn\u2019t have enough food.\nGoing to school in Kisii County in the 1970s was a tough affair. I think that the lack of basic sanitation and water and lack of clean public roads then were factors to motivate children to study hard.\nHUMANITARIAN\nIf I remember rightly, however, there was no corruption associated with primary school education in those days. That\u2019s why I am very disappointed that those attributes have lost their way in secondary schools and the resources allocated to education are taken for granted.\nWe now pay school fees for learners to attend school in a plethora of public and private secondary schools, from the cheapest to the most expensive, with that money being deducted from our salaries, in most cases at source.\nINVESTMENT\nSchools have become less than a business proposition, but even in public schools, there are ministers who have very little to do and are happy to allow principals and school administrators to sleep with the tail between their legs and run the institutions without bothering with much.\nMany young people think that the enjoyment of education is a privilege. Those who cannot pay the fees are forced to drop out.\nWe do not have a public school system in Kenya, so we are dependent on school fees to maintain schools and staff. The governments that have got us out of this mess should wake up to the reality that education is becoming too expensive for many.\nPAY\nSchools have become divided into elite and non-elite institutions. They are either in the capital city Nairobi or the lakeside cities of Meru, Embu, Kakamega and even western Kenya.\nDo we have private schools that cater for the less privileged in Kenya? No, because the parents prefer their children to study at schools in these \u201celite\u201d towns.\nAs the exam period looms, I want to urge everyone, including leaders and civil society members, to take a look at what we are doing to our students.\nMany parents think that a qualification from a university or a course in a university is all that their children need to succeed in life. The reality is that the future prospects of a large number of our children are being compromised by the poor quality of education we are providing them.\nUNEQUALITY\nAnother reality is that many districts and counties even without schools do not follow uniform law in registering, selecting and submitting names of candidates.\nThe students who are getting selected to study secondary school education are usually not the right people. This means that the quality of education in the country is bound to deteriorate, because students who have been excluded from the education system are going to repeat, drop out and sometimes to fail.\nIn fact, some of the students who have been deliberately excluded from the system often come back to take their exams as students.\nFAILURE\nChildren who drop out from school are left without skills or they are forced to go into debt to pay school fees.\nUnder these circumstances, most of the students fail to pay their taxes, which affects our economies.\nTo correct this skewed system, it is necessary that all students in the country should be given equal opportunity to take exams in the same school and selected for the same exam.\nPLEASE TELL ME\nBefore this year\u2019s exams start, let me ask Kenyans from all walks of life to join me and tell me what is happening in the education sector.\nIt is sad that we need to start a discussion on the quality of education in Kenya because most of the graduates leave our institutions with only about one year of learning.\nIf we really want our children to be leaders of the country in the 21st century, let us hope that Kenyans will unite to ensure that all students have equal access to education.\n", "domain": "nation.co.ke", "title": "GUYO: Create equal standards to give all students level playing", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "More This Author", "ind30k": 6409, "url": "https://www.nation.co.ke/oped/opinion/Create-equal-standards-to-give-all-students-level-playing-field/440808-5071696-v9wqcf/index.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "To quote Alex Rodriguez, just when we thought we knew everything there was to know about Tiger Woods, he came out of nowhere and showed us all.\nTiger Woods is the greatest player of all time, in my mind, which only makes his four-stroke victory in the Masters so much more special.\nSure, he's had plenty of victories and comes into Sunday with a mind-boggling 18 majors \u2014 only two behind Sam Snead. But getting that first one to finally win a green jacket has been a mighty tough road for him.\nWe\u2019ve seen him struggle with health problems, including two back surgeries. We\u2019ve seen him get over bad losses in the majors and post some super scores, like that magical 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in which he showed up in the final round as a triple-digit underdog.\nWe\u2019ve seen him regress and lose major titles and body parts. We\u2019ve seen him hit it a few feet farther over Augusta\u2019s water than he ever imagined, take too many shots to the eyes, boot the ball out of bounds or simply have his magic fail him.\nWe\u2019ve seen him every bit the goofy kid from Waynesboro, Pa., trying to make it in the world of golf with guts and perseverance and who once held the world record for longest putt.\nAnd when you watch Tiger win a major, it\u2019s as if we watch history. Every putt he makes he gives credit to his coach and the method that developed his remarkable skills, then he hugs his caddie and puts his putter on his wrist and lets the weight off his wrist and drops the putter.\nAt the end, he walks up to the green and simply taps the green, in step with the way we\u2019ve watched him throughout his career.\nWhile most players and fans knew it was only a matter of time before Tiger won a major, his victory at Augusta had people talking about it in a different way.\nA couple of things came to mind.\nOne, the miracle on the back nine. What a shot on the 16th hole to hole out from the wrong bunker and stay alive. What a putt to within 1 foot to win the Masters on the 18th. What a moment of calm, effortless good golf. He had nearly every trophy that eluded him before and they may finally be mine.\nTwo, the other players.\nIt was always considered Tiger's Kryptonite, the other players who had made him look great over his career. From the first time he walked the fairways in the opening round at Augusta, everyone knows what a special player he was going against.\nBut so far this year, we've seen players like Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Adam Scott, Patrick Cantlay, Rickie Fowler, Brooks Koepka, Webb Simpson, Billy Horschel, Brian Harman, Francesco Molinari, Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood, Francesco Molinari, Francesco Molinari and Gary Woodland \u2014 in other words a veteran's who Woods had beaten on his way to winning his 14 major championships.\nWhy did Woods have to beat so many accomplished players in order to get his first major?\nWe may never know the real answer, but it's certainly a question that will be put to him come Sunday night after he finally hoists that first green jacket.\nWoods has become such a star, whether he is playing the best or the worst, we always know what he is doing and think that, eventually, he is going to do something and that he is going to do it well.\nJust when we thought we knew everything there was to know about Tiger, he came out of nowhere and showed us all.\n", "domain": "deseretnews.com", "title": "Mike Sorensen: Everyone seems to love Tiger after his historic victory at Masters", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Mike Sorensen, Mike Has Covered Sports At The News Since", "ind30k": 7341, "url": "https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900065796/mike-sorensen-everyone-seems-to-love-tiger-after-his-historic-victory-at-masters.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "In time, the United States will become a more welcoming place. Finally, more of the world will come to America because the United States is a tolerant, welcoming nation that celebrates diversity and the very things that make our society unique.\nAmericans, of course, should not have to wait for that to happen before they see the country returned to the United States and to its rightful place as the \u201cland of the free.\u201d We cannot have the American dream unless the borders are secure and the movement of people is orderly. The number of illegal aliens entering the country is troubling.\nBut those should be the traditional obligations of a sovereign nation. In fact, there ought to be an obligation to increase the number of border agents when resources are allowed to spend. That\u2019s not the way federal officials are acting.\nThis has been going on for years. But now President Trump\u2019s shutdown threat to force Congress to complete his border wall has the nation on edge. Police departments should not be unprepared and taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be forced to foot the bill for police officers if the federal government doesn\u2019t want them.\nA House bill has proposed a $5.7 billion package of U.S. spending cuts as a compromise. For border agents, they would take $5.2 billion and transfer it to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s National Protection and Programs Directorate for overtime and overtime pay.\nFor the Senate version, in hearings, the Senate budget office has called that spending cut \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d and that such savings would be \u201caddressed as unnecessary in most cases.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same thing happening at all levels of government. State budget officers have said their state governments will be forced to close or reduce education and Medicaid programs if Congress doesn\u2019t provide the funding.\nFederal funding for border security accounts for just 4 percent of the total budget. There is no need to slash funding at the federal level \u2013 although Trump wants $5.7 billion \u2013 just as states are faced with the impact of a funding shortfall.\nThis should not come as a surprise. Since taking office, Trump has tried to divert funding away from other priorities.

{"article": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 His first PGA Tour victory in the bag and his ticket punched for next week\u2019s Masters, Corey Conners\u2018 primary concern was a big change to his work weeks going forward.\n\u201cNo more Monday qualifying,\u201d Conners said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best deal from this. Amazing. It\u2019s a dream come true. I won\u2019t be as stressful on Mondays.\u201d\nConners won the Valero Texas Open on Sunday less than a week after qualifying, earning him the final available slot in the Masters. Conners only entered the tournament field Monday, and he\u2019s the first golfer to win on the PGA Tour after qualifying on a Monday in nine years.\nHe made three birdies in the final five holes, shooting a 6-under 66. He was 20-under for the tournament, winning by two shots over Charley Hoffman.\nNext stop for Conners: Augusta, Georgia.\n\u201cMy wife got an email this morning letting her know we could check in for our flight back home,\u201d Conners said. \u201cI told her, \u2018Aw, don\u2019t check in yet. Maybe we can make other plans.\u2019 Big change of plans. It was going to be an off week. I\u2019m glad it won\u2019t be.\u201d\nHoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, shot 67 for 18-under on the week.\nRyan Moore closed with an 8-under 64, a shot off the course record, and was third at 17-under.\nSi Woo Kim, The Players Championship winner in 2017, led the opening three rounds but dropped to a tie for fourth with Brian Stuard (15-under) after an even-par 72.\nConners, the 2014 U.S. Amateur runner-up, will play in his second Masters. Two of the top three finishers last year at Augusta missed the top 10 this week. Rickie Fowler was tied for 17th while 10 strokes back at 10-under with a final-round 69, and Jordan Spieth (72) was 7-under.\n\u201cI definitely feel like I got good work done heading into next week,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good.\u201d\nStuard finished with 66 to get to 15-under. Kevin Streelman closed with an 8-under 64 and was 14-under. He missed tying the course record when, after four-straight birdies, he hit his approach from the 18th fairway into the gallery and bogeyed.\nIt was a wild round for Conners, a Canadian who had not won on any of the PGA Tour\u2019s affiliated circuits \u2014 he had finishes of second and third earlier this season. He had 10 birdies and four pars that sandwiched four consecutive bogeys on the front nine.\n\u201cAfter the middle of the front nine, I thought, \u2018All right, this is going to be my tournament to win,'\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cHe showed up and balled up. My hat\u2019s off to him.\u201d\nConners had a one-stroke lead when he rammed in a 34-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and stayed a stroke up with a tap-in birdie at the 14th.\nMoore joined Conners at the top of the leaderboard with an 8-foot putt at No. 16 that was his fourth birdie in five holes.\nMoore missed a birdie opportunity on the next hole when he couldn\u2019t convert on a putt from inside 10 feet. Minutes later, Conners sank a 10-footer to save par at No. 15, then hit to four feet to set up a birdie at the 175-yard par-3 16th. His birdie at No. 17 gave him a three-shot lead walking up the final hole.\nConners looked like he would tuck this one away early. He birdied four of the first five holes at TPC San Antonio. Trailing by a shot going in the final round, he benefited from a three-stroke swing on the leaderboard on the third hole with a 10-foot putt on the par-3. Kim hit into the water fronting the green and double-bogeyed. Later in the day, Kim was grabbing at his right upper body with an apparent injury.\nConners was two strokes ahead, and with birdies on the next two holes he led by four over both Kim and Hoffman.\nBut Conners bogeyed the next four, and three of those came after tee shots put him in nice position either from the middle of the fairway or close to it.\nThe other bogey, on a par-3 at No. 7, he hit his tee shot into a bunker, then blasted over the green.\n\u201cI told myself I could do it,\u201d Conners said. \u201cI had been hitting a lot of quality shots. I was really relaxed. I had a lot of confidence in my game.\u201d\nHe made the turn and clicked off three consecutive birdies. The last player to qualify on Monday and win a PGA Tour event was Arjun Atwal in 2010 at the Wyndham Championship.

{"article": "If you're a fan of Telemundo, you might have already seen some sneak peeks for La Reina del Sur: Part 2, but it's still hard to believe the beautiful drama and upcoming spinoff, which premieres April 13, will finally be here. Since it first debuted on Feb. 24, Netflix and Amazon Prime have each created its own compilations of the best moments from the first installment, which starred Natalia Tena and Carlos Ponce.\nI'll be honest: it was difficult to stay still watching, and at times, the pulsating English translation had me jumping up and down, screaming along with the girls.\n\"I was so excited when I heard about this!\" Ponce, who plays Don Omar, a rugged figure known for his every man appeal, said during an interview with HuffPost Telemundo. \"I was getting so excited when I heard it would happen.\"\nPonce credits the iconic show for giving him the opportunity to \"give it my all.\" And why wouldn't he? Don Omar is considered one of the best Latinos of all time, known for his sexy and handsome looks, eclectic taste in music, and sheer natural charm, not to mention his phenomenal performance.\n\"It was such a big opportunity and I got to show a whole other side of myself,\" he said.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut with all of the excitement, the real value of the show wasn't about the screen. Instead, it's about what happens behind the scenes with the cast.\n\"I had a great time shooting,\" Tena, who plays a sultry model with a mysterious past, said in an interview with HuffPost Telemundo. \"It was so much fun because we created a great rapport between the directors and the cast. Even when we're laughing with someone or when we're crying and [they ask], 'Why are you crying?' we all understand each other.\"\nOther people who weighed in on the authenticity of the show were legendary Puerto Rican comedienne Moises Alvarez, who created the role of Rosario, Don Omar's love interest, and Joaquin Brandao, known for his role as J.D. on Modern Family.\n\"It's well written, well acted, and well directed,\" Alvarez said. \"It speaks directly to Latin America, more so to its fan base.\"\nWhen I asked Tena if working with Alvarez was special to her, she had nothing but praise.\n\"Oh, it's awesome,\" she said. \"He's very kind to me. He's also very open. He helps me a lot with my Spanish.\"\nThe two characters share quite a history; Alvarez played a role in Tena's first scene.\n\"It was on a commercial and the two characters share quite a history, for example, he used to speak to me on the telephone when he was about to leave me for me to begin my modeling career,\" Tena said. \"So it was great for me to have him as my dad figure.\"\nAnd although Alvarez has influenced the characters and the character they're playing, he also advised Tena and Ponce not to overdo it, especially on the dancing part.\n\"You'll be absolutely in love with that and you'll be freaking out,\" Alvarez said. \"It has to be credible. Do not overdo it, do not do anything too embarrassing. Do not let anything be awkward.\"\nI'll be honest: it was difficult to stay still watching, and at times, the pulsating English translation had me jumping up and down, screaming along with the girls.

{"article": "When I hear SNP leaders talk about a \u201cprogressive,\u201d \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d Brexit, it disturbs me.\nIf people were really as progressive and radical as they claim to be, they would say they would accept the decision of the British people to leave the EU. They would bring the United Kingdom back together. And they would not be so desperate to snatch Scotland out of the UK without paying anything to cover the cost of retaining a membership fee.\nThis notion that somehow Scotland isn\u2019t \u201cus\u201d because we are in the UK, or have to accept that decision, seems to come out of nowhere. What is this about? Why is the SNP so determined to try to undo everything that happened before we joined the UK? Does everyone else have such a twisted view on this?\nTheresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and her agreement with the EU would bind us to paying money to Europe in perpetuity \u2013 not only our legal obligations, but much more money to be paid into a European account to \u201creserve\u201d for special projects such as the European Parliament.\nShe has agreed to the \u00a339billion Brexit divorce bill. She has agreed to pay the cost of leaving with the UK as far as we can see. She has agreed to the transition period. She has agreed to the transition period so long as we remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\nThis would continue for as long as we don\u2019t leave the EU at all. We may have to contribute money to the EU. We may have to make contributions to the European Employment Agency (EEA). We may have to make contributions to the European Airport Development Fund (EADF).\nAll up, Scotland would have to pay \u00a360m a year to the EU for 30 years. Isn\u2019t that a bit crazy? How are we going to do that? You are not going to pay to stay in the EU when it comes to taxes, say, or to sell your goods and services? It is a fantastical theory.\nJust to show what I am talking about, look at these figures. They are from a Scotland in Europe report (2018), commissioned by the pro-EU alliance Citizens for Scotland (CSS). It is an interesting study of what membership of the EU would mean. If we stuck in, for example, there would be:\n\u2022 \u00a33.9billion a year in funding to the EEA\n\u2022 Annual payment of \u00a3600million to the EU\n\u2022 100 civil servants in Scotland who are based in Brussels.\nIn the newspaper column, Demographics of a United Kingdom, the pro-EU campaign team wrote: \u201cThe UK\u2019s share of the global GDP is going to drop from its current level of 23.5% to 19.3% after we leave the EU. Scotland has some 23% of the UK\u2019s population, and 37% of its GDP. That is a 21% decrease in GDP. It is a massive drop, that will affect everyone on this island, no matter where they live.\u201d\nThe Leave campaign campaign claimed that leaving the EU would add \u00a3350 million to the British economy a week. If the economy is going to drop by 21% right after we leave, something is wrong with that. Those figures should not have been delivered.\nThe only way to keep our money is for us to leave the EU. That\u2019s what will happen. The politicians in Westminster are not going to go to the people and ask for approval. They are going to go to Brussels and collect \u00a339billion for free and they are going to tell the Scottish people we have to pay to stay in the EU.\nWe should vote them out next year. We should refuse to vote to have a Brexit. Let\u2019s vote for independence. Let\u2019s say we are the best sort of people \u2013 the best in the world. Then they can keep all that money and we can keep our money and decide what we want to do with it.

{"article": "Many of the topmost features in Rockstar's latest big multiplayer add-on for its upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2 title are focused on speeding up actual classic Western movies. On one hand, this is very fitting. What could be more appropriate for a modern incarnation of the West? But on the other hand, it's sort of awkward. Like, really awkward.\nBlasting Red Dead Online's slowdown and loading screens, which attempt to replicate the way that old Westerns have some slowness built in to the pacing of their shooting scenes, is actually kind of amusing. But what's also kinda funny is that getting rid of them is a major motion-picture story, like in Silence of the Lambs, Big Sick, and other genres. In Rockstar's game mode, however, the countdown to a gunfight usually runs down the clock, which means taking a few seconds at the beginning of the screen to make a load button. And the game almost never pauses between missions, so reloading is a major inconvenience.\nIf anything, Rockstar might benefit from watching other GTA Online expansions, like Real Money Missions, because the way the developer minimises the loading of slow-moving \"videotapes\" for the interesting missions at the start of each encounter is almost the exact opposite of the way the game handles loading on your character's screen.\nWhen the player returns to the same spot after a mission, the start of their screen is still immediately prior to the next mission. There's no before-and-after effect, no waiting to reload your gun after you pick up ammo, no slow-loading loading of \"unfinished\" footage. And it means that Rockstar has to more clearly communicate why its has slowed the player's load time, which seems like it should be an important difference for the game.\nRed Dead Online forgoes these little glitches because of the designers' focus on traditional realism, such as characters on screen with exaggerated speech patterns. When you're most of the way through a movie and you finally reach the end, you immediately wake up. It's a simple gesture of time.\nOn the other hand, some of the small number of previous glitches in the game's beta mode continue to be functional, while others are left unfixed. At times, all of the mobs you're fighting feel abnormally slow, which makes for a tedious dynamic. Fortunately, though, Red Dead Online still has just enough of these moments to make it work for me.

{"article": "New signing Chris Clark scored just 10 minutes into his Dons debut but Niall McGinn ensured Aberdeen got the double over Motherwell as he grabbed the goals in their League Cup semi-final victory.\nTom Rogic wrapped up the win in stoppage time after Aberdeen had largely dominated. The west of Scotland team had five goals in the previous six meetings between the sides, including seven in the Dons\u2019 3-0 win at Pittodrie in December.\nA sixth cup final appearance under Derek McInnes in a row would have represented a good return, and for McGinn, it could have come against Motherwell\u2019s other Old Firm rivals Rangers.\nHaving been forced out of his previous employers, the 34-year-old could have demanded a summer of lucrative offers but opted for a fresh start with the Dons, signing on a two-year deal earlier this season.\nHe failed to make the breakthrough on that occasion, with Gary Mackay-Steven and Kenny McLean scoring in a 2-0 victory, but he got his second in the half hour mark after his defensive partner for Motherwell, Stephen O\u2019Donnell, was adjudged to have tripped him.\nHaving played a part in victory in January\u2019s Betfred Cup final, an impressive opening 20 minutes by the Dons did not quite match that time. The game opened up with goalkeepers Joe Lewis and Scott Flinders for Scotland, and neither keeper needed a well-worked save in the opening quarter.\nThe standout chance of the opening period fell to Graeme Shinnie. The Dons skipper was unselfish with the ball, choosing instead to put it right at Shinnie\u2019s toes after Aly Cissokho had failed to deal with Shay Logan\u2019s low cross from the right. His delivery to the edge of the six-yard box was sublime, but McLean\u2019s shot from a tight angle was pushed away by Flinders.\nYet Aberdeen, who had begun brightly, didn\u2019t carve out a clear chance until the 36th minute. Shinnie and Mackay-Steven were the architects of the goal. Mackay-Steven pushed the ball forward for Shinnie, who controlled it with his back to goal, chipped Flinders and was offside when he nudged it back for McGinn to tap in.\nFor a long spell, McCartan and O\u2019Donnell had been justly bright for Motherwell, fighting for the ball, causing problems and tackling smartly. The former laid on an early chance for Stevie Hammell but the Irishman stabbed wide.\nMcGinn celebrated the goal in his usual fashion, pointing towards the rafters. Aberdeen\u2019s fight for the game grew, with Mackay-Steven equalising with a superb half-volley. Mackay-Steven had the best chance of the first half, knocking the ball home from eight yards after Clark and Lewis had combined but Flinders got a fingertip to the cross.\nAberdeen continued to look the more likely to put more goals past Flinders in the first half, but it was Motherwell, and their younger players in particular, who looked the hungrier. Adam Cummins and O\u2019Donnell were engaged in a game of good football in the Dons\u2019 half, while Keith Lasley and Stuart Murdoch almost found space down the left in the opening minutes of the second half.\nAs the game opened up, Motherwell broke upfield and exploited an opening to their defence. Sutherland brought down Shinnie at the edge of the box, the second penalty for McLean this season, as he controlled a Kenny McLean corner. Scott McKenna handled but no decision was made. Glasgow showman Rogic sent Shinnie the wrong way to win the penalty and seal victory.\nAberdeen should have sealed victory almost immediately, with Gary Mackay-Steven\u2019s volley clipping the underside of the bar. McGinn should have claimed a third when turned down by Flinders from six yards after omitting his offside flag, and he did a passable impersonation as he turned in from McLean\u2019s low cross.\nSubstitute Clarke thought he had given Motherwell hope with a header, but Aberdeen held on to go through to the final at Hampden Park, where they will take on Rangers.\nAberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Ball, Shinnie, Considine, Rooney, Clark, Shinnie, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, Vuckic.

{"article": "Traditional building materials are quickly being replaced by innovative products that have all the strengths of their predecessors while offering new and amazing advantages, as demonstrated by Prairie Rubber Paving. Through its synthetic rubber surfaces, Prairie Rubber Paving proves that you can have a surface that is beautiful yet durable, sturdy but flexible, and, above all, safe.\nThe overlay is composed of synthetic rubber that is specially formulated and manufactured for the purpose. \u201cWe use the highest quality synthetic rubber on the market,\u201d said Corey Redstone, the co-founder and President of Prairie Rubber Paving. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic EPDM rubber, and it\u2019s been produced and used in Europe since the 1970s.\u201d\nProviding maximum traction and minimum impact, the rubber serves as a reliable and attractive surface. It\u2019s an anti-slip product,\u201d Redstone said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest product on the market as far as something that you can walk on.\u201d\nOnce cured, it does not emit gasses or other substances, and, because the pigment is distributed throughout the rubber, it will not discolour or wear off. In brand new walkways and playgrounds, an under-layer of rubber recycled from tires can provide additional bounce. For greater resilience and longevity, Prairie Rubber Paving mixes polyurethane binders into its rubber. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely flexible, and, every colour you use, any project that we do, is made to be UV-resistant,\u201d said Redstone.\nThat flexibility also allows rubber paving to function on cracked or even slightly shifting foundations. Many conventional materials succumb to the prairie climate\u2019s cycles of freezing and thawing, but those surfaces can be revitalized by an overlay of rubber paving, which will completely cover the damage and fill in cracks and crevices.\nConsequently, a rubber overlay can be applied to decks, steps and driveways as readily as it can to gym floors, pools, splash pads and playgrounds. Those surfaces can be shovelled, washed or vacuumed normally. The porous structure allows water to drain away, but in indoor applications, the surface can be sealed into a non-porous state for easier cleaning.\nRedstone himself has been working with rubber for ten years, training and acquiring on-site experience with another company. \u201cAs that company grew a lot and I moved to Winnipeg, I decided that I wanted to change a few things to improve the product,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPrairie Rubber Paving has been in existence for six years. We started in Winnipeg and then branched out to Regina, Saskatoon and now serves Edmonton and Calgary to give full service to the prairie provinces.\u201d In Calgary, Stephen Rose directly manages operations.\nAs well as servicing the prairie provinces, Prairie Rubber Paving works closely with Jumpstart charities on accessible playgrounds all over Canada.\nIn order to distinguish his company from the opportunists who often gravitate to successful technologies, Redstone has patented his own Rubber FX system, which regulates the application of the product, the training required for foremen, inspections, warranties and other details of the Prairie Rubber Paving service.\n\u201cWith that system, we have a distinct process that we use with every single customer,\u201d said Redstone. \u201cIf you get a Rubber FX system, and a city or commercial project clarifies it, then it has to be under these strict guidelines.\u201d\nThe system has allowed the company to expand without compromising on quality. \u201cAny of the guys that we have working for us are trained installers \u2013 this product is the only product they work with,\u201d Redstone said. \u201cIf you hire Prairie Rubber Paving, you\u2019re getting an installer that has tons of experience rather than a guy that had just bought a franchise and popped out of nowhere.\u201d\nPrairie Rubber Paving stands by its work through a three-year, comprehensive warranty. \u201cYou have an issue with the product, you have an issue with the installation, that kind of thing \u2013 we look after it,\u201d said Redstone. \u201cWe also give a five-year warranty against cracking. Anytime you have a project and you spend your hard-earned money on it, you want to make sure that you\u2019ve got guys that are going to look after it.\u201d\nStephen Rose,\nCalgary Sales Manager\n587-892-6910\nEmail: Stephen@prairierubberpaving.ca\nTHIS STORY WAS PROVIDED BY PRAIRIE RUBBER PAVING FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\n", "domain": "calgaryherald.com", "title": "Discover the patented solution to resurface your driveway", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 4612, "url": "https://calgaryherald.com/sponsored/homes-sponsored/discover-the-patented-solution-to-resurface-your-driveway", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.2680882385077916}

Last year, he was in Wisconsin, which was ranked 19th by the media and went 13-1, including the Rose Bowl. The problem with that was everyone expected to win. There were whispers of overachieving. Then when you fall short, people don't buy in.\n\"Well, it\u2019s a business, isn\u2019t it?\" Andersen says. \"It\u2019s not a fair thing to do for people, but that\u2019s what you deal with, man. You don\u2019t let the negativity change your mind.\"\nThat's a lesson he learned at Wisconsin. When the Badgers won at Tennessee, they went to an airport bar and held a celebration among themselves. Then they took the team bowling and publicly announced, \"We're not going to win this thing.\"\n\"People look at things completely different,\" Andersen says. \"They can say whatever they want to say about your program and try to hurt your feelings, but ultimately I tell our kids, 'You\u2019re responsible for where you end up, so make sure you make the best decisions, the best decisions you can, make decisions that are in your best interest, and then just be thankful that you got to play.'\"\nIf it sounds repetitive, it is. Before he left Wisconsin, Andersen told students he wanted his program to be a \"life-long community of commitment.\" So it was with Utah State. There were some nice family moments, as well as winning a bowl game. Andersen insists his programs have always placed high expectations on themselves. Yet if people think he's peaking after two years, he doesn't buy it.\n\"It is what it is,\" he says. \"I was always confident in our players, and we felt if they went out and put together a good day in practice, our kids had confidence in what they were doing. It is a talented team, but it\u2019s not an issue.\"\nWith the USU job, Andersen understood the program's reputation. And from the day he was hired, he knew it was a business decision. His first year he ended the ban on satellite camps, knowing USU would have to use common wisdom. But now that it's over, he feels he's lucky because he hadn't hired enough people in his past.\n\"The brand of football you saw was worth the credit that they had,\" he says. \"I think I might have picked maybe too much on my own, that I was too much about the organization instead of people. And that just didn\u2019t turn out right for me.\"\nWith a 23-16 record over two years, and Utah State currently ranked 21st in the nation, Andersen got his way on some things. Though the Aggies lost their final two games in 2017, the pressure is lower this season, as is the conference's. He gave his players the week off after spring ball.\n\"For me,\" he says, \"seeing how long it takes them to get ready to play. I didn\u2019t want to put them in any games that were going to go like that. So I thought it was important.\"\nBy the same token, he can also ask them to hurry up and play.\n\"So if we win today\u2019s game, we don\u2019t need to play Thursday. If we don\u2019t win today, we don\u2019t need to play Saturday.\"\nThe schedule this year includes Montana State (road), Northern Colorado (home), Portland State (road), UNLV (home), Idaho State (road), New Mexico State (home), Weber State (road), Montana (road), San Jose State (home), New Mexico (road), Colorado State (home), Air Force (home), Hawaii (road) and Wyoming (home).\nA win over Northern Colorado this Saturday would make the Aggies 6-2 with three games left.\n\"It\u2019s a good situation,\" Andersen says. \"I feel good about where we\u2019re at.\"\nThe win over Wisconsin last year was another step, though a giant leap, given that the Badgers won 23 games in a row. Then again, a victory over New Mexico this Saturday would make Andersen 4-3 in eight games against former NFL foes.\n\"When you have a good attitude and work your butt off and work hard, those things pay off, you know what I mean?\" he says. \"So I\u2019m excited about where we\u2019re at, and if you\u2019re a fan of this team, it\u2019s", "domain": "deseretnews.com", "title": "Brad Rock: 'Talent not an issue' but expectations are for USU's Gary Andersen", "date": "April 06, 2019", "authors": "Brad Rock", "ind30k": 3532, "url": "https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900064301/brad-rock-talent-not-an-issue-but-expectations-are-for-usus-gary-andersen.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Open this photo in gallery Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury turns away San Jose Sharks forward Timo Meier during Game 2 on April 12, 2019. The Golden Knights posted a 5-3 victory to even the series at one game apiece. Josie Lepe/The Associated Press\nThe Shark Tank was rocking after San Jose erased a three-goal deficit in the closing minutes of the first period and appeared to score again in the opening minute of the second.\nThen, the referee waved it off for goalie interference and gave Vegas a power play that changed the momentum of the game and possibly the series.\nMark Stone scored the tiebreaking goal on that power play and the Golden Knights responded after the first-period collapse to beat the Sharks 5-3 on Friday night to tie their playoff series at one game apiece.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cFor our power play to come out and really bear down was obviously a big swing,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s momentum swings in playoff games every night. Every game is a new chapter in a series and tonight was a big win for us.\u201d\nThe teams packed an entire game into the opening minutes with the Golden Knights scoring three goals in the first 6:11 and the Sharks rallying for three more in the final 3:01 to become the first team in NHL history to tie a playoff game in the first period after falling behind 3-0.\nThe craziness continued at the start of the second period when the Sharks briefly celebrated an apparent goal in the opening minute by Brent Burns. That quickly turned to frustration when the officials waved off the goal because Logan Couture interfered with Marc-Andre Fleury, giving the Golden Knights the power play that led to the game-winning goal.\n\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. \u201cIt was definitely the right call. He hit him in the head. He tried to play the puck, he was defending his goal, he\u2019s trying to play the puck and a guy skates through the blue paint and bumps him in the head. To me, it\u2019s pretty obvious. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying down there.\u201d\nPredictably, that wasn\u2019t the view from the Sharks side, with coach Peter DeBoer calling it a \u201ctravesty.\u201d DeBoer said he believed Fleury was outside the crease when contact was made and was upset the referee called a penalty on what he thought was incidental contact because that prevented a chance at a replay review.\n\u201cThat one call is a two-goal swing and devastating for our group,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nStone converted from the slot after a scramble for his third goal of the series and Vegas held on from there, thanks in part to 34 saves from Fleury.\nStory continues below advertisement\nCody Eakin, Colin Miller and Max Pacioretty all scored in the first period to stake the Golden Knights to the big lead after losing the opener 5-2. William Karlsson added a short-handed goal in the third to ice it.\nGame 3 will be Sunday night in Las Vegas.\nCouture, Tomas Hertl and Joe Thornton scored for the Sharks, who were doomed by the lacklustre start and a poor power play. Martin Jones was pulled for Aaron Dell after allowing three goals on seven shots.\nPerhaps even more concerning for San Jose was the fact that defenceman Marc-Edouard Vlasic left after blocking a shot in the second period and didn\u2019t return. Couture also missed significant time in the second period after being hit in the groin area by a shot but returned for the third.\nThe Sharks had chances to tie it with an early power play, but allowed a goal on a breakaway from Karlsson instead to fall behind 5-3. They finished 1 for 8 with the man advantage, along with allowing two short-handed goals.\n\u201cWe just got outworked, plain and simple,\u201d forward Evander Kane said. \u201cWe can\u2019t give up two short-handed goals and expect to win in the post-season. We just got outworked.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nGallant had been unhappy with the compete level of his team in the opener, but that wasn\u2019t a problem early as Eakin scored just 58 seconds into the game after being left alone in the slot and the Golden Knights controlling the play early.\nThey even killed off one minute of a two-man advantage and scored a short-handed goal just after Colin Miller came back on the ice as he stole a back pass from Erik Karlsson and beat Jones on the rush to make it 2-0.\nPacioretty added his goal less than two minutes later after a turnover from Vlasic and it appeared as if the rout was on before a reckless penalty by Miller negated a Vegas power play.\nThe Sharks got on the board during 4-on-4 play with tic-tac-toe passing from Karlsson to Pavelski to Couture, who put the puck into an open net.\nKarlsson\u2019s shot from the point on the man advantage deflected off Hertl to make it a one-goal game and Thornton tied it with 52 seconds left in the period when he redirected a pass from Brenden Dillon after Evander Kane\u2019s hustle created the scoring chance.\nNOTES\nMiller played in place of Nick Holden after sitting in the opener. He scored the short-handed goal, but also took two penalties. ...

{"article": "It has been six long years since Richard Gordon and his staff built a football program from scratch. He is also aware now that, in some ways, he has been running a footie school for years.\nThe former head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos\u2019 World Cup team believes the Lions\u2019 lack of a European connection may very well have paved the way for his appointment last December as the new Vikes coach and Gill did his homework.\nBy coincidence, the Lions were having a \u201cproactive\u201d conversation with the new Eskimos\u2019 brass about a possible move for the GM and his German assistant, Omar Khan, when Gordon \u2014 who also coaches Richmond\u2019s Olympic football team \u2014 arrived to look at some data.\n\u201cRichard told me he was here in the room while I was sitting next to him,\u201d said Khan. \u201cAnd you can ask him why we didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nEither way, the 60-year-old Lions\u2019 FC are preparing for their debut in the ISL Canada Cup Saturday at McMahon Stadium where, as you might imagine, Canadian players are the story.\nThe Leos are comprised entirely of European players, 18 from Germany, two each from England and Holland, and one from Germany and Canada. All five of them moved to Canada to make football.\nAkiya Carr has played football for 10 years in Asia before coming to Canada to play at the CIS level, but the Leos\u2019 have invested heavily in the German contingent. Gordon had his scouts find Siele Suttner in Vancouver, who arrived on a basketball scholarship from Nebraska. Oliver Fraser played semi-pro in his home country and Murray Walker, the North Vancouver native who plays linebacker for Toronto, also scored a big-time scholarship from Nebraska.\nThe Leos know, however, the Ross Sheppard 6-6, 240-pound fullback Thomas DeMarco and the Dusko Filipovic 6-6 260 pound tight end, Tyson Fluellen, are both developing a bit slowly.\nAnd the Leos\u2019 have learned, if only through it all, that Canada\u2019s nether regions are not a good place to recruit soccer players.\n\u201cWe have been working very hard with these guys to find a place to work and try to get this going,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI\u2019ve been a lot closer to this game than I would have liked.\u201d\nIn fact, he\u2019s been as close as one of the B.C. Lions have ever been. The team signed one-time Karate Kid quarterback Tom Brady Waring out of Austria to a contract as a backup QB in 1982. And, according to one of Gordon\u2019s assistants, the Lions signed a player who was not from this country.\n\u201cWe had former Redskin Al Harris and one Canadian,\u201d says Shane McAlpine. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\nBut it speaks volumes about the world of football that it\u2019s not easier to find European players in the athletic department of the Lions than it is the Canadian Football League.\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding our own here,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cThe Lions are a team. We\u2019re confident we can do a good job of coaching and we\u2019re working with very good kids.\u201d\nKhan is also confident in his charges, which isn\u2019t surprising considering he coached against the Lions during his playing days. As a running back, Khan gained more than 100 yards in his only two games against the Lions in 1978.\nNow it\u2019s Gordon\u2019s job to get that side of the fence turned around and he\u2019s convinced that the European transplant concept can work.

{"article": "Last night\u2019s anniversary concert at Nashville\u2019s Ryman Auditorium saluted the legendary Hall of Famer Loretta Lynn with a concert featuring an all-star lineup of performers that showcased her rich voice, her love of country music and her remarkable resilience. \u201cI think life\u2019s one big song and Loretta Lynn sings some of the best songs,\u201d said country singer-songwriter Brandy Clark, who performed a surprise duet with Lynn, to open the show.\nThe concert culminated with an a cappella performance by the iconic five-woman group LANCO, which for decades has regularly filled the gaping maw of the Ryman\u2019s lower level. While the group made a mark outside Nashville when it toured with artists like Keith Urban and Lady Antebellum, they\u2019ve never been seen, or heard, in an amphitheater. But on the rare occasion where the women sit together onstage, they let their voices soar, so it was only fitting that they would close the concert with \u201cLadies Love Country Boys.\u201d\nLynn is famously homebound: her two children and husband have since died, she\u2019s kept her first home in Arkansas and can barely walk. But the Ryman is one of her favorite concert venues, in part because she recorded We\u2019re All Somebody From Somewhere \u2013 her last studio album released in 1984 \u2013 there.\nLynn herself helped select the artists performing at the Ryman, selecting Clark, Margo Price, the Kingston Trio and Kacey Musgraves to appear at the concert and Musgraves and country star Rosanne Cash to pay tribute to Lynn by singing a duet of \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter.\u201d But for Cash, a major beneficiary of Lynn\u2019s reach in the modern day as an advocate for open land preservation, the reason for the tribute, it turned out, was less about praise and more about addressing the harsh reality that America is suffering from a water crisis.\n\u201cI\u2019m probably one of the poorest people here because of the water I drink. So every time I hear about this woman\u2019s struggles with her water, it really troubles me. If she\u2019s struggling, I\u2019m struggling. So, I really want to show my support for her,\u201d Cash said, her voice cracking. \u201cSo here we are. Rosanne and I are going to sing \u2018Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u2019 to help her in this very big time of need.\u201d\nFollowing the duet, Musgraves and Cash \u2013 a mother of four boys \u2013 took the stage for Lynn\u2019s autobiographical hit \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter.\u201d Theirs was a touching \u2013 and heavenly \u2013 performance, and the women shared a moment, just like they\u2019d shared decades ago. Lynn\u2019s challenge, Musgraves explained, is to re-invent herself. \u201cShe gives credit to everyone who has helped her do that,\u201d she said, referring to the country legends who\u2019ve shaped Lynn, like Bill Monroe and Hank Williams, as well as the modern-day artists who have helped to transform her album The Coakley Family Christmas into a commercial juggernaut. \u201cEven though she has been around so long, people always say \u2018oh I loved you when you were just an old woman,'\u201d Musgraves said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and what do you do when you\u2019re an old woman? You change.\u201d\nAs Musgraves told the crowd, \u201cShe\u2019s the new country legend.\u201d\nThere was also an unannounced appearance by Loretta Lynn herself, who stood center stage and addressed the audience. \u201cI want to say thank you to the Ryman and to [host] Rosanne Cash and those beautiful ladies that performed with me,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cI\u2019m blessed. I\u2019m scared of what might happen to me.\u201d Her voice, she said, is compromised by medication. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do.

{"article": "The city\u2019s park board has approved a motion that would fine promoters of events like 4/20 and its following day party, Sip, up to $50,000 for \u201cserious violations\u201d \u2014 but declined to vote on granting the venue\u2019s request to move the event to a more suitable location.\nThe board\u2019s agenda had previously flagged that the planned festival scheduled for June 16-17 at the former Clark Drive Recreation Centre would be held outside city park rules. Multiple notices posted over the past year had warned the event was being held at an unlawful location.\nProvince files\nThe event, a scheduled tour stop for the American hip-hop band Cypress Hill, had been scheduled to take place at Clark Drive alongside the Fraser River, though it is not permitted to be on public land.\nThe park board\u2019s recent motion proposes \u201cenforcement measures\u201d \u2014 including fines from up to $50,000 \u2014 for \u201cserious\u201d violations, which the board said could include allowing illegal camping, camping, tobacco, drugs, hashish, animal cruelty, disturbing the peace and fraud, among other charges.\nThe motion asks the board to send the matter back to staff for possible enforcement measures that include \u201censuring that an adult is present at every 4/20 event in our parks, trails and neighbourhoods, and that the event is not held at unpermitted locations.\u201d\nThe park board\u2019s decision not to vote on the decision on moving the event to a more suitable location, which organizers initially requested in an April 2 letter, is likely to be the final stage in this year\u2019s conflict over 4/20.\nLate Friday afternoon, officials with event promoter All City Productions confirmed to Postmedia News that they were going to continue with plans to hold this year\u2019s event, as they always have. On its website, the company said it would make announcements in the coming days regarding the event.\nAt the board\u2019s meeting Thursday, panel member Coun. Geoff Meggs took the first motion to trial, and the board unanimously voted in favour of the measure.\nDuring the meeting, Meggs, who represents the downtown Vancouver-based Vancouver Park Board, recounted the history of 4/20 with fellow board member and Vancouver resident Paul George, noting that 4/20 had been scheduled at Clark Drive \u201cfor as long as anyone can remember.\u201d\nGeorge replied, \u201cIt\u2019s run by a relatively small, black-owned city operation\u201d that \u201cis at the heart of a lot of the social justice struggles in the city.\u201d\nAfter Meggs\u2019 introduction, the board voted in favour of a motion that would allow Meggs to bring the 4/20 issue to the table next year, with staff looking into \u201coptions for moving the event that are suitable for Vancouver and are in the best interest of its residents.\u201d\nPark board chair Stuart Mackinnon didn\u2019t speak to the issue, but later told Postmedia News that \u201cthe (council) saw fit not to vote\u201d on the other issue.\n\u201cWe consider this an issue that deserves a full council review,\u201d he said.\nThe incident that led to the conflict started in 2017, when organizers wanted to move the event from Sunset Beach to the former Vancouver Convention Centre West. At the time, the city decided the timing of the concert \u2014 an afternoon event \u2014 wasn\u2019t right for the North Shore area.\nYears later, though, organizers have again moved the concert, and this time it has gone out to Cypress Hill\u2019s tour.\nWhen this year\u2019s request was made in April 2 letter, the festival had already made other plans for the site, a former South African fairground.\nThe park board has a mixed record when it comes to policing the event. Last year, the board had two undercover police officers present at 4/20, though a spokesperson said their presence was not intended to exert pressure on event organizers.\nLast month, the board voted to revoke the organization\u2019s license to operate, accusing it of running an \u201cunsanctioned\u201d event in violation of park bylaws and other policies. The board upheld that decision after the event was moved to a private-slots site at the venue formerly known as Britannia Downs.\ndfumano@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/fumano\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

Instead, Brown received an assist on Jets teammate Zach Myers\u2019 double-overtime winner Wednesday, beating Avalanche rookie goalie Elias Beagle in front of a crowd of 13,979.\nThat means Brown will likely earn a nod as the series\u2019 second star, trailing only Flames captain Mark Giordano, who also had a hat-trick for the clincher against the Canucks earlier this week.\n\u201cI was kind of shocked, but it was a great job by him,\u201d Brown said with a smile following the Jets\u2019 third straight victory at MTS Centre. \u201cWe were just talking about it. We were trying to get tips and just have a little look over and see what was happening. I thought it was just going to be a light check or a hard check, but he said he was going hard. He\u2019s a very athletic player and he ended up making a great play.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting, and we had a great crowd behind us.\u201d\nSo exciting, in fact, that Gosselin gave the wide-eyed puppy a special treat after the post-game handshake.\n\u201cI took him out of his little box and gave him a big pat on the head,\u201d said the grandson of a Del Monte Growers manager and boyfriend of the family\u2019s long-suffering pug, Foxy. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even want anything.\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just because it\u2019s my third trip \u2026 they gave me his treat (at first) and I was like, \u2018OK, I want this one.\u2019 \u201d\nThat\u2019s because Gosselin is the proud owner of an all-time-great, who piled up 73 points while graduating to the NHL out of high school.\n\u201cThey show him all the time \u2026 when you get your A-level score, you got your A-level score,\u201d said Gosselin, a raw-boned winger from Merritt, B.C.\nMangiapane will need all the assists he can get in order to balance the books on his one-way contract, which tops out at $925,000 US.\nSure, he\u2019s shown some offensive fire this season with 10 goals and 15 assists in 70 games \u2014 despite a couple of missed games due to illness.\nAnd, when required, he can play wing, as he did against the Caps.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just playing for his game right now,\u201d said Flames head coach Bill Peters, who often tends to drop Mangiapane on the third line. \u201cHe can skate. I think he\u2019s working extremely hard.\n\u201cYou know what, there\u2019s going to be a lot of kids that are going to fight for jobs in this league.\u201d\nThere may not be a dog in the world that could help him.\nrvanstone@postmedia.com", "domain": "calgaryherald.com", "title": "Flames rookie Andrew Mangiapane shares special night with biggest fans", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 1091, "url": "https://calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames/flames-rookie-andrew-mangiapane-shares-special-night-with-biggest-fans/wcm/92a6cb84-f56b-4c14-a041-50f64af02201", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "What to Know Disney and Marvel\u2019s latest, \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d which takes place in 1995, has grossed over $900 million.\nMarvel's Kevin Feige has suggested that after \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 the Disney movie studio will focus on more narratives set in the past.\nDisney\u2019s big blockbuster franchise \u2018Star Wars\u2019 released a prequel in 2017, \u2018Solo\u2019, but was considered a big box-office disappointment.\n\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d is coming out on April 26, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios from hinting at what could be arriving after the grand finale of its most successful superhero franchise ever, a run at the box office for \u201cAvengers,\u201d which has so far racked up $4 billion. Next up: taking a step back in time.\nIn an interview with ScreenRant, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige discussed the future of Marvel movies, particularly with the \u201cCaptain Marvel \u201d characters and how he thinks there is still a lot of story left that takes place in the past.\n\u201cI mean, I think one of the things that\u2019s fun to us about the timeline of this film and the potential of future stories with these characters is there\u2019s a great past,\u201d Feige said. \u201cI think the fun part about seeing this portion of the MCU is that gap. ... The potential is there,\u201d Feige later added in regards to whether or not consumers can expect more solo-prequel adventures for Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s \u201cNick Fury\u201d character.\nThere is some precedent and reason to be concerned about the box-office potential for prequels: 2011\u2032s \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger\u201d was set predominantly in the World War II era, showing how soldier Steve Rogers became Captain America. It grossed just over $370 million worldwide on a $140 million budget. Its two sequels, \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d grossed much higher numbers, including $1.1 billion worldwide for \u201cCivil War.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d set in 1995, has grossed over $1 billion worldwide, but it may have an advantage coming shortly before this month\u2019s final Avengers installment, with many avid comic book movie fans eager to understand how Brie Larson\u2019s character connects to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Though that marketing tease tactic isn\u2019t new. Both \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger\u201d and \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d included post-credit scenes from upcoming Avengers films.\n\u201cHonestly, I believe [Marvel] will lose just a little bit of steam post \u2018Endgame.\u2019 It\u2019s only natural after the big set-up of \u2018Endgame\u2019 as the big finale. Everything that will come after that will fail in comparison,\u201d said Daniel Richtman, a media influencer who specializes in big blockbusters.\nThe box-office standard-setting in prequels is the other Disney blockbuster franchise: \u201cStar Wars.\u201d The late \u201990s to early 2000s Star Wars trilogy, distributed by 20th Century Fox, grossed no less than $600 million worldwide for each film, according to Comscore. However, the two sequels to 1999s \u201cStar Wars Episode I: Phantom Menace\u201d failed to even come close to the film\u2019s $920-million-plus worldwide total: \u201cStar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\u201d grossed around $647 million worldwide, and \u201cStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\u201d grossed around $847 worldwide, according to Comscore.\nWhen Disney acquired the rights to Lucas Films in 2012, it gave the Star Wars franchise new life with several of the recent films grossing $1 billion and more. \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d set prior to the events of the original Star Wars film, grossed over $1 billion and scored an 83 percent among critics on Rotten Tomatoes. But Disney\u2019s most recent Star Wars prequel film, \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d grossed just over $392 million on a $275 million production budget, according to Box Office Mojo, and has led to widespread questions about a \u201cfatigue\u201d point consumers can reach even with the most popular movie content.\n\u201cPrequels to blockbusters have had varying degrees of success over the years as compared to their sequentially released brethren,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a box office Analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go on forever in one direction, sometimes switching it up is a good thing and can deliver huge financial and creative dividends. This is long-term high-stakes chess, not checkers for Marvel.\u201d\nThe acquisition of 20th Century Fox assets was finalized by Disney in late March and that brings in even more characters for Marvel Studios, among them, Ryan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cDeadpool\u201d and the X-Men franchise.\n\u201cFortunately for them [Marvel] they got the X-Men, Deadpool, and many more popular characters back from Fox and with them the potential to build towards more big crossover events in the future,\u201d Richtman said.\nThere has been no official word from Marvel or Disney on when consumers can expect the Fox characters to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel did not respond for comment.\nAfter next month\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d 2019 will see only one more Marvel Studios film: \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home,\u201d a partnered picture with Sony. After that, consumers know that they can expect sequels to \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2\u201d for which original director James Gunn was recently rehired by Disney, but none of these projects have official release dates.\nOne film that Feige has talked about that could take Marvel in a completely different time-traveling direction is \u201cThe Eternals,\u201d a film set for release in 2020 which tells the story of two races created by Marvel\u2019s deities, The Celestials, millions of years in the past. The human-looking Eternals were created with superpowers to protect the earth from the other villainous race known as The Deviants. Feige suggested the movie could span over a 10,000-year period.\n\u201cJack Kirby did an immense, amazing epic with Eternals that spans tens of thousands of years, and that\u2019s also something we haven\u2019t really done,\u201d Feige said in the same interview. \u201cWhich is why that among many other things post-Endgame, we find appealing.\u201d\nScarlett Johansson\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d movie is also looking to be set before 2012\u2032s Avengers film, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nThe Harry Potter franchise has also been given a second life with its \u201cFantastic Beast\u201d franchise, set 70 years prior to the Daniel Radcliffe- Harry Potter adventures. 2016\u2032s \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them\u201d grossed over $814 million worldwide but its 2018 sequel, \u201cFantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grimwald\u201d grossed just over $653 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.\nDoug Stone, president of Box Office Analyst stressed that Marvel\u2019s assembly of characters is a strong advantage for its future and that there is a \u201csubstantial comic book fandom out there that knows the characters.\"\n\u201cMarvel\u2019s advantage is that there is a long list of characters that inhabit the Marvel Universe, and there is a substantial comic book fandom out there that knows the characters,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThe flexibility that Marvel has is to draw upon numerous characters and numerous storylines that have been in existence for quite some time via the comics. In the Marvel universe The Avengers changed numerous times over the comic book history encountering new and different foes all the while. That is not what I\u2019d call prequel-itis.\u201d\n\u201cAudiences accepted a giant purple alien with a rhinestone glove killing half of the universe, so the sky\u2019s the limit for what Marvel can adapt now and they have 80 years of stories to pull from and all of their characters are available now,\u201d added media influencer Jeremy Conrad.\n\u201cThe MCU has twenty-one movies of solid success to build off and where they are now, where they successfully made the Infinity Gauntlet a $2 billion success in live action, means there\u2019s really no limit to the crazy stories they can pull from in the comics and turn into live-action films,\u201d Conrad later concluded.\nThis story first appeared on CNBC.com.

It would've been his start in pro boxing.\nJack Whittlesey called the Wisconsin State Athletic Commission, and in a matter of hours, he and his wife Jarelle worked to get a law passed that would forbid holding a cell phone while driving.\n\"He was furious,\" Jarelle Whittlesey said. \"He said if he hadn't known that phone was being used to talk, I don't know what we would've done at the scene.\"\nThe new law took effect last week, which is the third anniversary of Whittlesey's death and a time of reflection for the Wilcox family \u2014 as well as other families who have lost loved ones in traffic accidents caused by people who were using cellphones and texting.\nOne of the two \"Speed Kills\" billboards in downtown St. Paul commemorates Jarelle Whittlesey's son. Two sisters of Michael Cordaro were here this week to help spread the word. And the widow of Ray Rush, who was killed on his Maplewood motorcycle in 2010, was here to speak.\nThe wave of tragedies has inspired lawmakers to try and push ahead with a statewide ban on cellphones and texting while driving. Minnesota legislators are considering a bill that would ban both driving and texting, and a number of other states are also considering a ban.\nBut, even if the bill passes this year \u2014 and that's an uncertain, longshot \u2014 it won't affect much about the driving practices of people like Jarelle Whittlesey.\nShe has no legal recourse, because there's nothing in Minnesota law saying cellphones or other devices or technologies \"may\" be used while driving, Jack Whittlesey said.\nState law, Jack Whittlesey said, says people can be ticketed and have points taken off their licenses \u2014 but there's nothing prohibiting those same people from holding the phone they're using to hold the phone to read a text.\n\"That's what gives the law added enforcement value, to be able to take those driver's licenses away,\" Jack Whittlesey said.\nLawmakers say the final debate on a statewide ban is far from being decided. So the Whittlesyres' efforts to pass a law alone, with no hope of its passing, might seem little more than their way of helping to end the tragedy.\n\"I think it's all about protecting the kid,\" said former Rep.

{"article": "VIRGINIA ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- The unthinkable has happened.\nWith baseball's Boston Red Sox already in the World Series, Notre Dame has replaced the team in our minds with its cathedral, the iconic 13th-century tower looming above campus at Notre Dame College on Virginia Island.\nRELATED: Notre Dame student mourns loss of father in SUV crash\nFor decades, the spectacle of Notre Dame's soaring Romanesque spire rising 862 feet (255 meters) over the city as it shepherds students and tourists across the Atlantic, lit up at dusk at the opening of spring on that Virginia Island peninsula, had been enough to defuse the soul-sapping anxiety of being a college student -- and made the holiday weekend a beacon of the Catholic faith.\nThat's what everyone liked about Notre Dame and what the visitors seemed to love.\nBut it's been reduced to rubble in this week's deadliest high school tragedy in the U.S. since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado.\nThe fall of Notre Dame Cathedral was a surprise. The student newspaper tweeted Monday that \"the cross on the highest point on Notre Dame College is gone,\" without elaborating.\nPHOTOS: Notre Dame Cathedral through the years\nEven in an online quiz offered by St. Mary's College in South Bend, Indiana, for a quiz of Catholic Catholic colleges, Notre Dame's cathedral topped the list of three.\n\"We were a little shocked,\" student Sarah Walker said Tuesday of the cathedral's fate. But \"it's not really unexpected,\" she said, given that Notre Dame College is an adult education school where nearly 30 students are attending classes Tuesday.\n\"It just seems so far away. It was definitely a big 'Wow.'\"\nThe \"wow\" may have been literal.\nScott Wilson, an English professor at St. Mary's College, said in a telephone interview that he has students and colleagues arriving in the mornings at his office across from Notre Dame College, check to see if the cross is still there and ask him what they should do with the holy day, Divine Mercy Sunday. They usually say Mass in the cathedral.\n\"When we say that's not possible,\" Wilson said, \"they say, 'But we know where the cross is; we know where it goes -- to Mass,' so they're going to go to Mass.\"\nThey have started doing so with their phone cameras out, he said.\n\"Many of them said they had never taken a picture of the cathedral, let alone taken it because they knew that they had to go to Mass there, and they couldn't miss it,\" he said.\nHe noted that there is a note in the glass of the cross and, since the day after the tragedy, there has been a request by police in Prince William County, Virginia, not to light candles, not to set them off on fire or shoot fireworks in the beautiful blue-green morning sky,\n\"Every day I wake up the minute I walk in the door and I check to see if there's a note saying, 'No candles, no fireworks,'\" he said.\n\"I'm sure they do, as well,\" he said. \"They do this on Good Friday, we do this on Holy Saturday.\"\n\"I just think the students are shocked, I really do,\" he said. \"But I think they're incredibly, incredibly grateful for the support of our Catholic community and the students, and also the outpouring of the community, the Catholic world. ... I think the thing that I have heard from a lot of students is that they're glad to be able to share this with our friends, but they're also really grateful for the support of people they don't know, like the 5-year-old daughter who knew the choir director, and her parents who said, 'We're in this together.'\"\nWilson said he prays that people, especially in Central Michigan, where Notre Dame's campus is, see this story \"through the lens of tragedy.\"\n\"The worst thing that happened here is this terrible tragedy that we all think was unnecessary and too tragic, but it's still a tragedy,\" he said. \"It's just tragic, just terrible.\"\nContact The Associated Press at 800-450-2345 or apandall2@ap.org.

{"article": "Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Hiroshi Nakaso speaks during an interview with Reuters at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, April 26, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato\nTOKYO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Japan\u2019s new leadership has hinted at a less ambitious inflation target. Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso, an advocate of the 2 percent goal and architect of the BOJ\u2019s QE programme, said on Wednesday it is the \u201ccentral bank\u2019s job\u201d to reach that goal, but that the government should also play a role in achieving it. He told Bloomberg TV later the day that the government should drop a clause in the post-World War Two constitution preventing intervention in the market.\nInstead of the government setting a specific number of yen in yen terms, Nakaso suggested an inflation target based on economic output. Achieving 2 percent inflation would require 2.3 percent growth, or 4.6 percent if the government acts aggressively to increase corporate and consumer prices, he said.\nBut an easy monetary policy depends not only on maintaining a goal, but also on achieving it. And achieving this is tough, with many economists counting on Japan\u2019s \u201cquasi-state\u201d to exert strong influence on wages and prices, with the government and central bank acting as an overarching entity. After presiding over months of the best economic data on record, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is due to step down in June, bringing new leadership to the table.\nNakaso does not pretend to have the answers to this problem. He also said that financial markets were unstable and the BOJ had no plan for more than a period of \u201cample\u201d quantitative easing. In particular, the BOJ\u2019s first priority is to achieve the 2 percent target. Because the collapse of a yen-denominated bond exchange-traded fund in October, driven by the tail risk of a debt ceiling impasse in Congress, pushed prices lower, there are no legitimate reasons for a discussion of a 2 percent inflation target now. In exchange for setting up this goal to achieve, the BOJ has helped prolong deflation. Instead, it should have set a shorter-term goal \u2013 around the time that 3.5 percent inflation would be reached \u2013 and intended to step down as soon as 3 percent inflation is reached.\nThose, along with other market and fiscal reform proposals \u2013 these should be on the table in the coming months as the BOJ considers how to get out of an ultra-easy policy that will probably take a long time to exit.\n", "domain": "reuters.com", "title": "Breakingviews - Guest view: Halve Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target", "date": "April 26, 2019", "authors": "Koichi Hamada", "ind30k": 8036, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-breakingviews-idUSKCN1S20IL", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "PROGRESO \u2014 When a fire ant\u2019s home mound is disturbed, the workers below the surface release pheromones that alert the under colony of a nearby intruder. After that, it\u2019s best not to stand still.\nYou can see a similar tactic on the soccer field when the Progreso Red Ants feel like opposition offense is a little too close to their net and goalkeeper Arturo Gallegos.\nOver the course of the 2019 season, Progreso has conceded only 25 goals, while netting 148.\nIn the playoffs alone, the Red Ants have outscored their opponents 12-4.\n\u201cOur defense is strong,\u201d said Gallegos, a senior. \u201cIt\u2019s the best (part) of our team right now. They help me a lot, they make my job easier. I still need to play hard, not only our defense but me too.\u201d\nThe Red Ants will compete in the regional semifinals at 2 p.m. Friday against the Taylor Ducks at McAllen Veterans Memorial Stadium. A win would send Progreso to the regional championship on Saturday where the program can punch a ticket to its fourth state tournament in as many seasons.\nEven Matthew Perez, the team\u2019s leading goal scorer, knows the defense plays a crucial role in the group\u2019s quest for a state title. He points to Edgar Melendez, the team\u2019s sweeper, as a reliable backstop.\n\u201cI trust him because we\u2019ve been together since middle school,\u201d Perez said of Melendez and the defense. \u201cWe\u2019ve played together on the same team since. It has been a huge experience playing with my friend. I know in a low-scoring game there is more pressure for the defense than offense because of the fear that someone might score.\u201d\nGallegos has also been teammates with the man directly in front of him on the field for a long time as well, which makes a difference.\n\u201cHe\u2019s my defender, we have been together since freshman (season),\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cWe know each other well and we talk to each other during the game.\u201d\nProgreso\u2019s team and head coach know that the regional tournament is another level of talent, they have won the past three Region IV Class 4A tournaments.\nThe Red Ants plus-8 goal differential is second to Gonzales who they could meet in the regional tournament. The Apaches knocked out fellow RGV Class 4A powerhouse Hidalgo 1-0 in the area round.\n\u201cThese upcoming games are going to be the hardest games of our season,\u201d said Melendez, another senior. \u201cYou just gotta man up and do the work to try to win.\u201d\nCoach Margarito Jimenez says a stingy defense is a must-have for prolonged success.\n\u201cIt goes all the way down to the middle school and they have done a great job for us,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cDefense is what starts our team. Without a strong defense, it\u2019s going to be hard to win games. So yes, it is one of the main focuses every year.\u201d\nJust like the last three Progreso seasons, the Red Ants boast a strong core of experienced players.\nThe middle-school program is essential to the high school team and many of the players have stuck together since their seventh-grade year.\nProgreso can stay in any match thanks to its defense, but Red Ants earn its household name for their bite and subsequent sting.\nMost of that responsibility is on the shoulders of another senior, Matthew Perez who has tucked away 34 goals this year. The forward knows that his opportunities will probably be less frequent than during their 13-1 District 31-4A campaign.\n\u201cIn regionals, there are fewer opportunities to make goals, so we have to take advantage because you might only get one or two chances to score,\u201d Perez said through a translator.\nIf Progreso can advance to Saturday\u2019s regional final at noon it will face the winner of Gonzales and Canyon Lake.\n\u201cStep by step we can make it to state again,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWorking as a team, fighting as a team can make us win regionals and head to the state tournament again.\u201d\n", "domain": "themonitor.com", "title": "Progreso Red Ants led by defense, another experienced senior class", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 8152, "url": "https://www.themonitor.com/2019/04/11/red-ants-led-defense-another-experienced-senior-class/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.2921970142249224}
{"article": "What is happening?\nIt has been a year of drought for many cities in the country. Rainfall patterns are shifting in some parts. This weather phenomenon, called La Nina, changes the period for rainfall every two years. It should typically start around July but has not happened in most parts.\nLa Nina starts with hot and dry weather, lasting until October-November. This season, the weather in March was cold and dry, causing snows in the north and losses of a whopping Rs 10,000 crore to the kharif crops in Uttar Pradesh.\nThe state chief minister Yogi Adityanath, government of India and neighbouring states are yet to decide on options to deal with the drought.\nMeanwhile, there is a drought not only in Delhi and other North-eastern states but also in North and Central India. Severe droughts have hit in Odisha, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and some parts of Bihar.\nWhat is this effect on people?\nThe ongoing weather phenomenon has affected over 11.5 crore people in 17 states. Of this, around 8 crore people have been affected in 14 states. According to the Integrated Mapping and Assessment of Drought in India (IMAD) report, nearly 3.5 crore people are affected in rural and urban areas in Haryana.\nThe situation is similar in parts of Maharashtra. Nearly 2 crore people are affected in the state. Around one crore farmers have suffered due to the drought.\nIndia has suffered from prolonged drought in several years, though meteorological department has attributed this to changing climatic patterns. High temperatures are often blamed for deteriorating crop prospects and consequently, a potential threat to human lives.\nDo we face this a lot?\nProbably. The Himalayan and parts of central states are prone to cyclones that come in winter, which are referred to as drought season. In 2009, Maharashtra, Pune, Goa, and Konkan witnessed crippling power cuts following a monsoon failure. Thousands of people died and two lakh homes were destroyed.\nAlso, the harvesting of kharif and rabi crops have become difficult due to the low rain in the previous season and predicted hot and dry weather. This factor has affected poor farmers the most. In Tamil Nadu, the number of drought-affected persons are more than three times that of the number affected during a rainy monsoon year.\nWhat are the warning signs?\nThe sound of heavy rainfall has also been noticed in southern parts of the country. The weather front, which originated in Puducherry and passed through Kerala and Tamil Nadu, will now travel through Tamil Nadu, then Karnataka and Kerala and is expected to reach Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha in the next few days.\nIn the last few years, there were several floods due to heavy rainfall.\nWhat is the forecast?\nThe IMD officials said that it was only an early indication and no deep depression or cyclonic circulation in the region is predicted to form. They also warned that it might not last long. The next season might see a dry June and good rainfall by July. This forecast, however, is for the Pathanamthitta region of Tamil Nadu.\nFirst Published: Apr 14, 2019 09:36 IST\n", "domain": "hindustantimes.com", "title": "Allergy season worsens with changing climate", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Asian News International", "ind30k": 8152, "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/allergy-season-worsens-with-changing-climate/story-89ljWnDGnfk6wYs1gEKmcI.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "Mick Jagger in Barbados with Jerry Hall, just prior to his fortieth birthday. Wally McNamee\nWalking through the lobby of the Fairmont hotel in Monaco, home to the Backgammon World Championship, is like striding through an aquarium. Well-tended women, summa cum laude graduates of the Ivanka Trump School of Advanced Moisturizing, move through the first-floor casino as if in schools, their older boyfriends, many of them Russian, in tow. Call girls, only slightly less well tended, perch on couches and sip cocktails from long straws. There\u2019s a throwback bad-taste glamour here in Monte Carlo, the Las Vegas of Europe. One waits for Engelbert Humperdinck or some other sideburned lothario of the 1970s to sidle past in a leisure suit. Yet the Fairmont, in its way, is an up-to-date sin palace. There\u2019s the thumping of EDM from the hotel\u2019s Nikki Beach roof bar. Out front there\u2019s a crush of valet-parked Porches, Bentleys, and Maseratis glinting in the July sun. The hotel sits on a hairpin turn that bedevils Formula One Grand Prix racers and has caused countless crashes. The calm on my first morning is shattered by a distraught gambler who rocks the lobby\u2019s ATM as if it were a pinball machine, slapping it and calling it his bitch because it refuses to dispense money he no longer has.\nAmong these beautiful people, the most elite backgammon players stand out, the way roadies do on an Ariana Grande tour. Some 190 players are here from all over the world competing for $250,000 in prize money. Nearly all of them are men. Many, if not most, are unshaven introverts in cargo pants or dad jeans. They\u2019re \u201cfroggish men, unpleasant to see,\u201d in the words of an old Randy Newman song. On the first morning, I see a crowd gathered around a match in the hotel\u2019s conference room. I peer across the rows of heads. Akiko Yazawa, then the world\u2019s number-three-ranked player and among the game\u2019s few great female adepts, is competing. It\u2019s fun to watch her play, in part because she\u2019s brilliant and in part because, as one spectator tells me, \u201cshe\u2019s attractive-attractive, not just backgammon-attractive.\u201d Akiko wears a T-shirt with a backgammon board on it. The caption: \u201cAnd they call this fun?\u201d\nI\u2019ve traveled to Monaco to compete in the World Championship. I feel I am plausibly ready, at least in the sense that George Plimpton was plausibly ready to sub in for a few plays as quarterback of the Detroit Lions. I\u2019ve been playing backgammon since I was a kid, often in all-night, low-stakes gambling binges with friends. Lately I\u2019ve been really working on my game. I live in New York and I\u2019ve sat in with the hustlers in Washington Square Park and Bryant Park in Manhattan. I\u2019ve devoured a pile of books with titles like Backgammon: The Cruelest Game. I\u2019ve watched classic matches on YouTube, the way a wide receiver studies game tape. I hired a tutor, a pro who lives in Virginia, and took online lessons. Additionally, I\u2019m sickly addicted to a pro-level backgammon app on my iPhone. I play twenty or thirty games a day. It\u2019s my go-to stress reliever. It beats a black-tar-heroin habit.\nJust before I flew out\u2014in a moment of pride or panic, I\u2019m not sure which\u2014I reached out to Victor Ashkenazi, the number-one-ranked backgammon player in America. Victor lives in New Jersey and at the time was a vice-president at Goldman Sachs. I\u2019d read about him. I emailed Victor out of the blue, told him I was going to compete in Monaco, and asked: Would he agree to a match with a relative novice, to let a guy know what he was in for? Victor texted me back: \u201cHaha why not?\u201d\nWe meet on a warm spring Saturday at Bear and Birch, a Russian banya, or spa, in Freehold, not far from where he lives. It\u2019s where Victor goes to unwind. The place is modern and well lit, yet it has that emotional five-o\u2019clock shadow that clings to so many restaurants and other spaces in New Jersey. You can imagine a Sopranos-style hit going down in a corner sauna. Victor, who is in his late forties, is late and apologetic. He has a six-pack of beer under his arm. (The place is BYOB.) He\u2019s so tall that he has to lean down to say hello, his shaved head gleaming. \u201cYou want to have sauna?\u201d he asks. So we sit, towels around our waists, and bake. Victor\u2019s family emigrated from Russia in 1995, he tells me, when he was twenty-five. Back then, he knew maybe twenty words of English. \u201cI\u2019d played chess as a kid, and I noticed the chess games in Bryant Park for small stakes,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I noticed this other game, one I\u2019d never seen back home. They were playing for more money than in chess! Backgammon was more competitive and volatile. The crazy arguments helped me to learn English.\u201d\nVictor has a gift for numbers. He landed a job as a computer programmer, and at night he played online backgammon. \u201cI have a good visual memory,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember positions and patterns. And I\u2019m a sports guy. Backgammon is a sport. There are long hours playing\u2014long, long, long. It\u2019s like a boxing match. You have to have stamina and a strategy and the will to win.\u201d He played in his first major tournament in 2007 in Las Vegas, the largest one in the United States at the time. He won it and he was hooked.\n\u201cI am reminded of Mike Tyson's comment that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\"\nWe climb out of the sauna. Victor pulls out a shiny black-and-red backgammon set that looks like it belongs to a Bond villain. (James Bond plays backgammon. In Octopussy, Roger Moore suavely defeats a cheating Middle Eastern cad.) The pieces on his board\u2014these are called stones, blots, men, or checkers\u2014are marble and have an agreeable heft. Hurling one, you could stop a charging Pussy Galore in her tracks. Backgammon is a racing game. You want to get your fifteen checkers around the board and then remove them, a process that\u2019s called \u201cbearing off.\u201d If you get your checkers off the board first, you win.\nI have a small shot against Victor, I think, because backgammon involves some luck. About 80 percent of the game is chance. This is one way it differs from chess. If you sit down opposite Magnus Carlsen, the world\u2019s top chess player, you have zero hope of winning a game. Chess is 100 percent skill. A casino game like roulette, on the other hand, is entirely luck. Backgammon sits, tantalizingly, in between. It allows enough luck that, if only in the short term, David can slay Goliath.\nWe start playing. Here my memory goes somewhat blank. I am reminded of Mike Tyson\u2019s comment that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. During the first five or six games, Victor doesn\u2019t just beat me; he does to me what Sherman did to Atlanta. After about thirty minutes of abject defeats, I begin to pull my wits together. I slow down and analyze the entire board before moving, as the pro I\u2019d studied with had taught me to do. I start counting my \u201cpips\u201d\u2014the total number of places I need to move to win\u2014to determine whether to use the doubling cube. I start to win the occasional game. My eyeglasses unsteam. Victor begins to heckle me. \u201cWhat a luck-box,\u201d he says, grinning, when I roll a series of doubles. He says it with a lingering Russian accent, so it\u2019s like having Count Chocula dis you. Then his girlfriend (now his wife), Alia, who\u2019s watching, chimes in. \u201cLook at this guy, Victor\u2014he thinks he\u2019s a tiger.\u201d Later, she says, \u201cLook at his big balls. Hear his big balls clacking.\u201d Victor adds, \u201cWhat a luck-box.\u201d\nBackgammon and the good life in Acapulco, 1972. Slim Aarons\nSoon I realize we\u2019ve been playing for five hours. (We\u2019ll play for eight.) I begin to appreciate once again why backgammon has more juice than any other game I know. Its highs and lows are intense. With its weird mix of luck and skill, it\u2019s the game that most resembles life. Like life, it offers extreme reversals of fate\u2014fate that can rain down on you like magic or bury you entirely. It\u2019s a game that small children can play, yet it takes a lifetime to begin to master. It\u2019s the only thing I know, besides sex and skiing, that you can do for eight hours and still want to keep doing. There\u2019s something oddly moving about the game, too. In order to win, you merely need to find your way home.\nBy now it\u2019s dark. We get up to leave. I see that Victor has barely touched his first beer, while I\u2019ve had several. Don\u2019t drink and play; that was my first unspoken pro tip. I think I\u2019ve done moderately well until Victor remarks that my checkers play was poor and my use of the doubling cube was dismal. A game of backgammon may be only 20 percent skill, but if you put that number in Las Vegas terms, you realize how overwhelming that percentage is. In a craps game, the house is a favorite by only 1 percent, yet it rakes in the money. Imagine if the house were a 20 percent favorite. I never had a chance. Victor looks down at me and shakes his head. \u201cMy friend,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cyou are like a little child lost in the woods.\u201d\nThe Backgammon World Championship in Monaco unfolds over nine days. The first three days are given over to preliminary tournaments in which the top prize is $22,000. The championship takes place over the final six. After observing the talent in the room, I decide to play in the intermediate division. I want a fighting chance to land in the money. Here we go!\nMy first match in the preliminary tournament is a breeze. I play a cocky little Frenchman in a polo jersey, and all the breaks go my way. We play a nine-point match, which ostensibly means the winner must win nine individual games. But when the doubling cube is laid down, you can quickly find yourself playing for two, four, or, more rarely, eight or more points. In backgammon, you double if you\u2019re in a winning position. The other player can accept or resign. If they accept, only they can double the next time. The Frenchman is annoyed at my dominance. He\u2019s annoyed, too, at my sloppy backgammon etiquette. He reminds me that dice must be shaken vigorously, as if you were making a margarita. He reminds me to roll only on my side of the board. Back in Bryant Park, these niceties matter less. I win in about an hour.\nThe next afternoon, my second match also goes well. My opponent is again French, a woman in her late forties. She casts a certain Mrs. Robinson or Jackie Onassis glamour. It occurs to me that much of the game\u2019s lingo has sexual overtones. When you roll a five and six early in a game, for example, so that your checker sails over the board like Evel Knievel over a row of school buses, it\u2019s called a \u201clover\u2019s leap.\u201d When one of your open checkers gets hit by an opponent and put out of action, on the game\u2019s center bar, you are \u201cdancing on the bar.\u201d I\u2019m in the zone. I double aggressively, and it pays off. I win the match after about forty-five minutes. When I report the results, I look at the brackets on the wall and realize I am only one victory away from finishing in the money. Hot damn. I decide to look for Victor to give him the news.\nIt takes me a while to find him across the expanse of the conference room. But here he is, midmatch. His T-shirt says, \u201cI bought this T-shirt with your money.\u201d He\u2019s winning. But as I stand over him, watching, he begins to falter. He shakes his head after making a minor counting mistake. His dice rolls turn sour. I fear I\u2019m his cooler, so I walk away. When I see him much later that night, he\u2019s irritable. He\u2019s not doing well in the tournament. But he\u2019s scanning for something more important: men and women known in the backgammon world as fish or pigeons or marks, wealthy players who might want to test themselves for large stakes against a pro. He finds one and disappears.\nTina Turner as she appeared in a photo for the cover of Backgammon magazine in 1979. Andrea Waller\nI look around for a private game myself, but most people have left. The atmosphere in the hall, with its fluorescent lights, is grim. I can\u2019t find a player, and the bars are mostly empty. And not for the first time, I wonder: What happened to backgammon? When did it lose its chic and fall off the cultural map? Can we get those days back?\nThe game itself is as old as the pharaohs. According to The Backgammon Game, by Oswald Jacoby and John Crawford, Homer mentions a version of it in The Odyssey. The Roman emperor Claudius had a built-in set on his chariot so that he could play while on the move. Shakespeare and Chaucer each cited the game in his work, and Thomas Jefferson played while drafting the Declaration of Independence. In a notebook of his expenses during the summer of 1776, Jefferson wrote:\nLost at backgammon 7/6\nWon at backgammon 7d / 1 / 3\nAs recently as the 1970s, backgammon was a pop-culture obsession. Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Paul Newman, Tina Turner, and the members of Pink Floyd were photographed hovering over boards. Thousands of players flocked to tournaments in Las Vegas and the Bahamas, where winners took home million-dollar prizes. (The top prize money at tournaments today rarely reaches one-twentieth of that sum.) From 1977 to 1980, The New York Times ran a weekly backgammon column by Paul Magriel, a master of the game.\nBackgammon became a jet-set phenomenon, but its popularity first took off in private clubs in London and Manhattan. The game had an aura of cigar smoke and black tie; it was something you might play while eating a haunch of venison and sipping Madeira. In 1966, the Times sent a reporter to cover the burgeoning backgammon scene at Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Club. He came away with unintentionally hilarious quotes like \u201cAll these men are members of the different Ivy League clubs. You see the type of men they are\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s always been a backgammon game available in the good families.\u201d Backgammon seemed like just the thing to play if you wanted to be the first to lose your head when the revolution came.\nIn Playboy, Hugh Hefner began to print photographs of tanned celebrities playing the game with adoring women. Sports Illustrated sent reporters to cover backgammon tournaments. The attention was good for backgammon\u2014and bad for backgammon. The secret was out. The wider world had discovered the game, but like airplane travel, it slowly lost its cachet. To put it in Yogi Berra terms, backgammon got so popular that no one wanted to play anymore.\nShady players such as the Israeli-born Gaby Horowitz invaded the scene. Horowitz\u2014who at one point was married to Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder trial\u2014was a West Coast hustler who seemed to have walked out of an Elmore Leonard novel. He was a brown-eyed ladies\u2019 man who was accused of cheating by manipulating magnets under his board. In a bizarre twist of fate, Horowitz was accidentally shot by another backgammon player, a gun collector, in a freak accident in 1989, when a bullet ricocheted off a ceiling and into his head. He was paralyzed and never heard from again.\nThen the number crunchers began to arrive, as they have in all professional sports. The game started to be broken down by computer programs. The first of these, created by IBM\u2019s Gerald Tesauro in 1992, used neural networking to teach itself to play. These programs, over time, have thoroughly deconstructed the game by assigning equity values to every possible position. No one used to know what the best move was; now they do. The game has become one of memorization and mathematics, increasingly for whey-complexioned nerds who play and study all day in their basements. Nowadays playing with your heart or with your instincts will get you nowhere.\nThe final blow came with the advent of online poker and the live broadcasts of poker tournaments on cable television, beginning in 2003. Poker stole what little thunder backgammon had left. It offered higher stakes and a shot at fame. It\u2019s a casino game, and backgammon can\u2019t really be played in casinos. There\u2019s no place for a dealer in backgammon, for one thing. For another, a game involves only two players and can take a long time. It simply isn\u2019t profitable. One former backgammon champion, Erik Seidel, is now a poker legend, having won eight World Series of Poker bracelets. He made the switch partly because it was easier to find poker games. Players flock to poker, he tells me, because cards are familiar to them and because poker appears to have, at first glance, a lower barrier to entry. \u201cWith poker, people can delude themselves for a longer period of time in terms of their skill,\u201d he says. \u201cIn backgammon, a novice will get killed constantly. In poker, a newbie might think he can actually play.\u201d\n.\nWant more Esquire delivered on the daily? Subscribe to our newsletter.\nI\u2019ve still got a shot in the preliminary tournament. But then I get knocked off by a stringy fellow with an unplaceable accent who rolls double sixes the way Roger Federer fires aces. As he does this, he shakes his head philosophically and says, \u201cEh, it\u2019s backgammon\u201d just as Jack Nicholson\u2019s partner said, \u201cForget it, Jake, it\u2019s Chinatown.\u201d I lose again later that day and then again the following morning. I\u2019m out.\nI wake up early the next morning, the first day of the World Championship, and seek wisdom from the Israeli-born Matvey Natanzon, better known as Falafel. He got his nickname from his favorite cheap lunch. Falafel is a backgammon-world superstar, a man who became a world champion while homeless and playing in Washington Square Park. He\u2019s almost certainly the only living backgammon player to have been profiled in The New Yorker.\nFalafel is an endearing slob who\u2019s a treat to watch play. He rubs his belly, rocks back and forth like a diviner, and grimaces and sighs as if he were Zero Mostel. He\u2019s as close as backgammon has to a celebrity. He won\u2019t confirm it, but he\u2019s said to have been hired by Leonardo DiCaprio as a tutor. \u201cI keep trying to get out of this game, but they keep pulling me back in,\u201d he tells me. The prize money in backgammon these days is barely enough to make it worthwhile, he says. I ask him if he has any advice for me. He encourages me to take my time, to study the whole board before moving. Then he says, \u201cYou will also need the gods on your side.\u201d\n\u201cBackgammon is the only thing I know, besides sex and skiing, that you can do for eight hours and s\nSitting with Falafel, I wonder: What does this guy have, in terms of ability, that I don\u2019t? An inborn gift for numbers, for one. Plus, he became a champion because he was literally hungry\u2014desperation can bring a lot out in a person. It\u2019s why good boxers rarely grow up in houses with manicured lawns.\nThe championship starts. I\u2019m nervous. I suddenly want this thing. First I play a sweet older man who resembles my father-in-law and played in the 1973 Backgammon World Championship in Las Vegas, nearly winning. This fellow is in his eighties. I later discover he is gravely ill with cancer. He genially destroys me. My next match is in the evening. I badly want a martini to steady my nerves, but drinking and professional backgammon don\u2019t mix. I pace. In my room, I consult my backgammon books. I try to keep my wits about me.\nThe next day, I lose again. And the next day. I burn through my consolation rounds and then my last-chance rounds. My luck, and my focus, have gone to hell. My tournament is over. All that\u2019s left to do is swim in the Mediterranean, play blackjack, eat oysters, and watch the others.\nI brood over my bad math skills. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that the tournament is ultimately won by a little-known Frenchman, Didier Assaraf, who other players say is savant-like and has an aptitude for numbers. It\u2019s the last day. Victor has been avoiding me. He hasn\u2019t done well in the tournament, either, but he\u2019s apparently done well in his extracurricular matches. He asks me if I can carry a wad of money back to the States for him. I make a face that says, \u201cReally?\u201d He says never mind.\nI fly home and mope about my game. I buy more instruction books and upgrade my computer program. I text Victor: \u201cHow about another match?\u201d We meet again at Bear and Birch, this time in early fall. We take some steams. We eat chewy Russian dried fish. We begin to play. He annihilates me, but not as definitively as he did earlier in the year. He calls me a luck-box once in a while. In the end, he admits that there\u2019s a fair to middling chance I might find my way out of the woods.\nThis article appears in the March '19 issue of Esquire.

It has meant that a lot of his style, as with Barbra Streisand or Mick Jagger, has lost some of its dark roots and more has kept it that way.\nFriday night\u2019s concert at Rogers Arena saw him returning to his rock roots. It was the Vancouver icon\u2019s final show in the city before taking his Be Yourself Tour to Edmonton, Calgary, Montreal and Toronto before finally ending the year with three shows in Mexico.\nAnd no one who saw the rich, detailed and low-down touring show \u2014 featuring three bands backed by a pit of 20 singers and 10 musicians on stage \u2014 would argue with the notion that Bubl\u00e9 is making a pretty passionate go of it.\nHe plays like it\u2019s Christmas and a return to the Who\u2019s stoned feeling Beatleley blues arena set, but just by virtue of his intense, straight-ahead songs, more inclined to tell a story and pull the heartstrings. There\u2019s always a story.\nNaughty Marietta Blues\nIt was his 2011 love song, Crazy Love, that got the crowd more fired up. The two-song opus that was based on a love triangle that runs through his youth ended with some hard hitting gospel-y organ driving an introduction of heartbreak.\nSoon he was belting the gurgly Heartbreak Tonight. He hadn\u2019t quite reached the other classic of his repertoire, but he did seem to be comfortable doing it.\nPerhaps the most enduring song of his 19 year career is a high-intensity take on the Barbra Streisand broadsheet pop career classic, The Way We Were. The track is by turns celebratory and grumpy, the focus on his vocal chops like warm molten wax.\nIt\u2019s the well-worn routine on the comeback that each single \u2014 this includes Love You Again from 2014\u2019s To Be Loved album \u2014 gets a missive that explains a few details about where we find the artist and the road ahead.\nNo surprise that its also the song most fans seem to like the best. Even though he\u2019s made it better with his 2010 smash rendition of It\u2019s a Wonderful World, he makes it the one he wants to reprise for his crowd.\nThe performance also found the singer in an impressive form as he looked out on the crowd at about five-minute intervals at various spots along the song list.\nAt one point, he brought a choir on stage to sing Sweet Christmas.\nHe took time to talk to fans who asked questions about the band or the venues he had been.\nA chat about childhood with his brother turned to talk about how his brother Brett is now a busy modernist architectural designer who comes up with some of the most iconic buildings in the world.\nAlong with being an amazingly gifted and skillful performer, it appears Bubl\u00e9 has really figured out a few tricks of the trade as he approaches his 40th birthday.\nYou just hope he never gets tired of doing it, at least on the road.\nmlreddeyn@postmedia.com\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

{"article": "We all know that orgasms don\u2019t come in just one form. I, for one, am often so floored with desire for a partner that I wait until the minute we touch each other before reaching climax. And it\u2019s not just about how much you are aroused or your willingness to have sex. It\u2019s a lot about the timing of it all.\nIf you\u2019re sex starved, a timed climax can help. It\u2019s like cocktails \u2014 you only want it when you are drunk, but not too drunk. But if you want to be in the moment and have multiple orgasms in one night, there\u2019s a scientific formula to it. While many of us may not be that observant, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t benefit from learning what these research-backed techniques are. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nAs research recently revealed, the best time to orgasm is 12 minutes after penetration \u2014 but if you want to orgasm as quickly as possible, study after study has shown it\u2019s best to have sex at a sexy time (not necessarily the same time) and not necessarily at your partner\u2019s (if he works late).\nMore: The Most Compelling Orgasms\nThe ideal response to stimulating the clitoris in conjunction with your penis can only be achieved if the pressure is on just that one point \u2014 the point at which the circular nature of the clitoris makes it very difficult to stimulate and has engendered the concept of a single-orgasm trap. Two-hour periods without orgasm feel artificial and mechanical; a timed orgasm can feel so sensual because it is not.\nTo learn how to last as long as possible while having orgasms, repeat a sexual technique you know works or find a technique that does not, like popping one ring back and forth to stimulate the dong.\nIf you\u2019re having a really bad orgasm, there is no cure. But if you try to speed up the process or go faster on the throttle with tactics to maximize intensity, it can definitely help.\nOrgasms are often scheduled, since you are often able to schedule several to last two or three hours before bed. And sometimes, we forget about a great orgasm once we are tired or feel a little anxious. Here are some ways to avoid letdowns \u2014 and enjoy having multiple orgasms.\nSometimes a wake-up call (or go-to date) isn\u2019t the best way to get going. In this case, try creative ways to bring on a few too many. Take two vibrators, put them out on the floor in a choreographed affair, watch your partner masturbate, push your feet to the middle of the bed and try to wake them up (gently, of course). If you have the time, try your partner\u2019s vibrator as well.\nOnce you get aroused and into a euphoric state, the general rule is to stop at a vaginal orgasm, which is so different from an orgasm during penetrative sex. The reason is because with penetrative sex, there is more control over the timing of the sexual intercourse, whereas a vaginal orgasm is spontaneous and comes out of the body and through the vagina.\nWhen there is no control, such as vaginal orgasm, it is easier to experiment with other triggers, techniques and timing to make you not only last a lot longer in bed but also have multiple orgasms.\nFor the longest lasting vaginal orgasm, it is best to have sex at a sexy time (not necessarily the same time) and not a time that would be pleasurable or impactful for your partner. If you and your partner have sex at bedtime, it won\u2019t affect the mood or your performance; in fact, you might sleep better because you have less distractions to deal with.\nIf you have a need for speed, try slowing down the intensity of penetration or using your other tools.\nThis story was originally published on SheKnows.\n", "domain": "sheknows.com", "title": "How to Have Multiple Orgasms \u2013 SheKnows", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Charyn Pfeuffer", "ind30k": 5418, "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/2026658/multiple-orgasms-are-totally-possible/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "As the elections for the May election are nearing, India, like the US in the last two years, has been trying to politicise a regional and international problem. Most recently, the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has held an initiative to boycott the Pakistan-sponsored SAARC Summit in Islamabad this November, seeking to avoid his impending visit to the General Assembly in New York.\nAccording to the Senior Advisor at the Department of State (State) Bureau of South Asia, Subhash Kapila, India would only participate in the Summit if Pakistan does not pull out of the SAARC. Kapila, in an interview with the BBC, said that \u201cThe more we can pressure Pakistan in not coming to this summit, the better chance we have of it happening\u201d.\nMany countries, including India, have boycotted the SAARC Summit in the past because they were not sure about its impartiality. India\u2019s reluctance to attend this year\u2019s SAARC Summit has followed similar cancellations by Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, which said that their attendance would be meaningless without the other countries participating.\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was originally founded as a regional forum for cooperation on trade, tourism, transit, science and technology, education, infrastructure, trade, science and culture, energy, environment, social and women\u2019s issues and cross-border cooperation in May 1985. Over the years, it has expanded into a multi-national forum comprising of 22 member states of the Commonwealth of Nations, eight economic and two technical experts commissions, four scientific councils, five experts advisory committees, two experts action group councils, and another 17 non-member states. Today, members of the SAARC also include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, China, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Iran, Palestine, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, and the US.\nIn the past, India has boycotted the summit not because of security concerns or religious sensitivities, but because of Pakistan\u2019s hosting of Taliban leaders in military encampments, considered to be sanctuaries for the insurgents. The Uri terror attack of September 2016 that killed 18 soldiers and wounding 18 others made India more impatient to boycotted the Summit.\nIn the words of Mukesh Ambani, \u201cPakistan and Bangladesh were two SAARC members which failed to form a cohesive think tank and a body to tackle internal concerns.\u201d\nBut the reason that India and other South Asian countries have not attended SAARC is because they think that it is not an effective forum to address transnational issues like terrorism, energy, poverty, and trade, and because many other regional groups already have the upper hand in regional trade negotiations with India. The main problem that India and other South Asian countries have with the SAARC is the two most important issues, which are Afghanistan and Kashmir. India thinks that both these issues should be left to the regional organizations and should not be dealt with by a forum of SAARC members alone.\nIn a recent interview with Indian press, Kamalnath Tagore, former minister of information and broadcasting, said, \u201cIndia will join the SAARC Summit only when the 30 member states have decided it is no longer useful.\u201d This statement by Tagore makes it clear that India thinks that the Summit should focus on other regional areas like eliminating poverty and refugees rather than India\u2019s two most difficult issues, Kashmir and Afghanistan.\nInstead of following the U.S. policy on the South Asian situation, India should take a positive and forward-looking stance, and that may enable it to achieve its objectives as a regional power by becoming an active member of the Association of South Asian Nations (ASAN).\nThis forum, comprised of more than sixty countries, exists to help member countries to set up regional institutions, among which is a Regional Integration Development Agency (RICA). This organization has already found its own role by being a mechanism for the regional countries to discuss initiatives for cooperation, investment, trade, and economic growth, among other things.\nIf India can cooperate with the larger countries of the Asia Pacific region through ASEAN, it can do the same for the rest of South Asia through ASAN. In doing so, India will enhance its power in the world. That will not only be a win-win scenario for both India and the region, but also it will serve as a lesson for the US.\nM Waqas Jan (mwaqasjan@gmail.com) is a renowned journalist and commentator on South Asian affairs\nPublished in Daily Times, April 16th 2019.\n", "domain": "dailytimes.com.pk", "title": "The \u2018high-risk low-gain\u2019 politics of the Kashmir issue", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "M Waqas Jan", "ind30k": 3851, "url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/377187/the-high-risk-low-gain-politics-of-the-kashmir-issue/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "When it comes to video games, players tend to forget that March is actually the month of new games. After all, sequels and iterative updates attract much of the attention, making big new releases like those often forgettable.\nHowever, that hasn't stopped one game -- Kingdom Hearts 3 -- from taking a staggeringly large chunk of the rest of the month.\nWhen download sales were factored in, the \"Disney meets Final Fantasy\" third entry in Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts franchise was the best-selling game of February. The game has now been available digitally for 11 days, and \"gained 1,125,000 downloads\" last month, according to GameSpot. The game's release month was two weeks earlier than previous Kingdom Hearts games, so it's clear the market didn't lilywhite it.\nKingdom Hearts 3's release came after numerous delays, a rather repetitive marketing campaign and a subsequent chance for fans to pick it up as a digital download and try it for themselves. With the potential sequel performing so strongly, it's sure to be a hit when it eventually hits consoles and handhelds in the future.\nCNET Magazine: Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition.\nFollow the Money: This is how digital cash is changing the way we save, shop and work.\n", "domain": "cnet.com", "title": "Kingdom Hearts 3 is the best-selling game of 2019 (so far)", "date": "April 23, 2019", "authors": "Daniel Van Boom", "ind30k": 68, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/kingdom-hearts-3-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2019-so-far/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "By Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South and Paul Olayemi\nBishop (Dr) Godday Iboyi Okokporo, JP, is General Overseer, Promise Kingdom Ministry Inc. Worldwide, aka Overflow Chapel, with headquarters in Sapele, Delta State.\nOkokporo, who turns 43 today, is also the \u2018Prophet of Okpe Kingdom\u2019 and President-General of Okpe Christian Council.\nIn the past two weeks, it has been merriment in Sapele as residents, whose lives he has touched, lined up series of events to celebrate him.\nHe spoke to Sunday Vanguard in an interview last Monday. Excerpts:\nWinning souls\nGod has really been using me to reach out to many lives; we have won many souls, populated the kingdom of heaven and depopulated the kingdom of hell because my primary assignment and mission is to win souls for the kingdom. This is what we have been doing for the past 18 years. My ministry is into taking care of widows and the less privileged. Over 100 persons are on our scholarship, we also have the prisons ministry and if you go to the Sapele Prisons, they will tell you of our impact. The Controller-General of Prisons even wrote me more than five times through the Deputy Controller -General of Sapele Prison appreciating me for reaching out to people in the prison. Every month, we give substantial part of our tithes to the prison to support them and, even during my last year\u2019s birthday, we took a day off to go the prison. We also go to orphanages and lepers to render assistance and prepare them for the kingdom of God.\nI never wanted to be a pastor\nIt was a difficult task. When I was small, people told me about a pastor who came from Guyana. My mother was in Accra, Ghana then, she was born there. At eight years old when she went for crusade, a man of God from Guyana walked towards my grandmother, the late Madam Agbeyo Idisi, and told her that \u2018this little girl you are carrying will give birth to a child, number three among her children and he is going to be great and he will help humanity.\n\u2018When this child is born, take care of him very well and he will try to run away from his calling, but God will handle him and he will come back to Him just as Jonah did in the scripture\u2019. My mum left Ghana and, after many years, she got married to Mr Iboyi Okokporo. After giving birth to the first child, Vero, she is now married to Ezekiel Eyarefe. She gave birth to Keffe Iboyi, my immediate elder brother and then me. So my grandmother said the prophesied child had been born and took me away. People started asking why and she said a prophet gave prophesy to her about the child many years ago, but I went through a lot of challenges from the very first day my mother got pregnant to when she gave birth to me.\nREAD ALSO: Without Ifa, there\u2019d be no Google \u2014-Ooni of Ife\nOn April 14, 1976, when l was born, people thought I would not survive. It took me five years and three weeks to walk. It was obvious the devil was playing pranks on me, which is why, if I see anybody in problem, I use my last resources to help him. My life is a living testimony from day one. My father died some years later and my mum, after doing her best, died too. My father was a priest of the Alleluia Church and I grew up there. Alleluia church was brought to Nigeria by Evangelist John from America on February 2, 1954 and the name was later changed to Full Gospel.\nMy father renounced his faith because the church was not doing well, we also did. Many years later, another man of God rose to take over the ministry, Pastor Peter Efemini, now Reverend Peter Efemini, he is now under me. God used him to organize a crusade and, before that crusade, the late Evangelist Cousin Mosheshe and Mimiyerijesu came to the community and prophesied that God was going to use me. They said I was going to be a very great man of God. They prayed for me and left, but I was not convinced. My thought was that pastors do not do well. A day later, Jesus appeared to me and said \u201cmy son, I am the one that spoke through my prophet from Guyana that you are going to be a great prophet and I am going to use you though it is not your will, let my will prevail\u201d. I woke up, it was a dream.\nI left the community and went to Port Harcourt to stay with a friend for about a month. I was there when the dream came again. God told me to go home or you will die. I refused. Then I was involved in an accident and I almost died. I worked in Nigeria Dredging and Marine. I was a former rubber merchant and also palm oil dealer. I also worked at Songhai Delta. God gave me money. At the age of 19, I already had over N4m in my bank account. So when the calling came, the little money I saved, about N15m million, I used it to buy land for the church. I ran into problems. My businesses then were not progressing.\nI will pray and pray and somebody will appear before me in my dream and say \u201cyou cannot run away from me, so come back to your Maker\u201d. There are three types of pastors: Those God called and their arrival was announced by God, those who followed leaders because of their willingness to serve God and God used them, and those who just love the calling, the way pastors dress (these are the people causing confusion in the today because they do not have the spirit of God fully in them). This is why I could not join politics because God said if I play politics, they will paint me black. I asked God whether politicians are not righteous and He said Christians, minor prophets can play politics but major prophets should not; even in the Bible they did not play politics.\nThen I came home and another crusade came and the Lord said \u201cgo to that crusade because I want to make another relationship with you\u201d. I went to the crusade and I re-gave my life to God, so the pastor started taking care of me. From there, I became children\u2019s teacher. Later, l joined the choir and from there l became youth leader, choir leader, assistant pastor doing before God called me again. The Lord said \u201cI am going to use you to do great work and your ministry is going to be Promised Kingdom Ministry Incorporated Worldwide, aka Overflow Chapel\u201d. I asked, \u201cwhat is Overflow Chapel?\u201d\nThe Lord said Overflow Chapel is from John 23 verse 5, which says \u2018I will prepare a table before you in the presence of your enemies, and your cup will overflow\u2019 and He told me that anyone who believes in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. He said the ministry was going to be overflow of healing, overflow of deliverance, overflow of everything and that is how the ministry started.\nHow God finally got me\nSo this great man of God, Rev Peter Efemini, who God finally used in converting me told me that God said he should come and work under me, that once a man is under a king, no matter the bead the man is wearing, he is still under the king. He said I should not be afraid that I am carrying the crown, which was why he left Full Gospel where he trained me, nurtured me and brought me up to Promise Kingdom. Reverend Efemini is still working with me now. I re-ordained him. He is now a Bishop-elect and, as I am moving to Archbishop now, he will be the next Bishop. Our ministry officially started on September 26, 2002 and we used to go from village to village.\nPeople would say \u201ccome to the city\u201d and I would say \u201cno, if everybody goes to the city, who will preach to the people in the villages?\u201d And when people saw the anointing, the healing of the blind, they said this is real. There were so many miracles then, so they started trying to take me out of the community. But the king said, \u201cMy son, if you leave now, you know we do not have any major prophet in Okpe Kingdom, please stay with us.\u201d He had to use everything. I became the \u2018Prophet of the kingdom\u2019 and then the President-General of Okpe Christian Council. I am in charge of over 3,000 ministers in Sapele and Okpe. We have branches in the kingdom before we started taking the ministry out of Delta. We are now in Edo State and Abuja branch will open in May.\nAbduction\nWe have been praying about the issue of Sapele and that is why in past years, we organized crusades, seminars, to educate our youths. Yes, there was a time in Sapele that you could not fgo around freely without running into kidnappers. It is true that l was abducted on November 30, 2015, at about 9.25 pm, because they discovered that God is using me to reduce crime in the society. Some evil people decided to kidnap me after they discovered that occultists and native doctors in Sapele were coming to give their lives to Christ. I have used my hands to burn 340 shrines, we broke some building used for idol worship, and they met and decided to stop my activities.\nThey tried physical and spiritual things, no way, so they finally decided to kidnap me. When the kidnappers came, they told me that their mission was to kill me. One of them said l was a big man, \u201cso let us take him away and demand a ransom of N100 million. They took me away to a forest. Six of them actually came to the house to abduct me but in the forest, I counted 21 of them. God showed that He is God. I prayed to Him that if it was Him, Jehovah, that called me, that all the kidnappers should go blind, while providing a way of escape for me. Even me that prayed the prayer was amazed. I was seeing them but they could no longer see me.\nThey now started begging me to help them, saying, \u2018Man of God, we know you are a powerful man, please pray to God that our eyes should open\u2019. My king and others brought soldiers into the forest and they were shooting into the air to intimidate them to run away and leave me. I think what God did in response to my prayer was to prepare the way for my rescuers. They ran in different directions as they heard the overwhelming gunshots. I perceive that in the race for death and life, God opened their eyes, but they did not run in the direction the shots were coming from. Since they had run away, I started shouting for the search party to know the direction of where I was.\nWhen I came back and people heard the story of what happened, many gave their lives to Christ. I do not even know today whether the kidnappers were among those who gave their lives to Christ. If you do not know, God does his things in mysterious ways. Now, we have been doing our best to make sure Sapele is safe. Most of the people-causing problems in Sapele are not from here and we are still trying so that, with one voice, we can achieve our aim.\nDevil fights back\nBesides the kidnapping, demonic forces almost killed all my children. Four of them took ill and were admitted in hospital at the same time because I am into deliverance ministry. Every Wednesday, people come for deliverance from all parts of the world. Those that are barren, people who have problems in their educational life, those addicted to smoking, doing drugs, and so on come for the service. When God delivers them, the demons start fighting back, sometimes my cars will just go up in flames. Some days ago, three generators packed up. Last year, a generator blew up. That was the devil fighting back, but God will tell me the reasons for such happenings and tell me not to worry about them. If anybody tells you that the ministry is easy, it is a lie. What pastors go through sometimes is hell. We go through pains. When you rescue a man from the devil, be rest assured the devil will not rest.\nThe problem with Sapele\nWe have one problem in Sapele, disunity. Inside that disunity, we have discrimination, then that spirit of \u201cit is not my business\u201d. Many in Sapele still have this spirit of pull him down, they will do anything to pull you down, even in politics, we see them too. I was the President of Amukpe Christian Council for six years, about 38 denominations. I just handed over to Reverend Bukeno of Christ Chosen Church and we are trying to conquer these problems. Sapele is backward spiritually and in everything. Look at our only seaport, it is not functioning. AT&P is dead, Eternit is gone, and Life Flour Mill is struggling to stay afloat, but we are praying that things should move on. Thank God for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. He really tried for Sapele. He is the only governor who has made us understand that Sapele is still a place to remember. In his first tenure, he really tried for Sapele. We pray that he does more in his second tenure. Sapele is, however, growing spiritually now, all we need is unity to move Sapele ahead, and prayers to make it recover its lost glory.\n", "domain": "vanguardngr.com", "title": "21 kidnappers went blind in Delta forest after abducting me \u2014 Bishop Okokporo", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "View All Posts Emmanuel Okogba", "ind30k": 6973, "url": "https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/04/21-kidnappers-went-blind-in-delta-forest-after-abducting-me-bishop-okokporo/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.31430172752029006}

{"article": "Auburn\u2019s basketball program is positioned to compete on the national stage next season as the Tigers attempt to make the trip to Madison Square Garden for the 2018 NCAA tournament.\nThough the final decision rests with Jim Cannizaro, the Auburn head coach who has held the job since late December, the team is on the upswing after the most successful season in program history. While the NCAA tournament selection committee may lean toward highly ranked programs as contenders to make the Final Four, if Auburn is to have a shot, its resume in the next month will have to warrant a higher seed.\nAuburn enters 2019-20 as one of the top-five ranked teams in the country. A season ago, it was one of the last teams ranked and enjoyed its share of success -- including a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament -- but a failed tournament bid, coupled with roster losses that amounted to nine players from a year ago, likely left the Tigers in the position to bounce back as early as this season.\nInstead, this season marks the first time in 15 years Auburn has had a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament and is the first time in four years it\u2019s had a team ranked among the top 25 nationally. That would make the SEC tournament last weekend\u2019s 40-point blowout of Texas A&M an especially major success for the Tigers after the road trip featured blowout losses at Mississippi State and South Carolina to start the week.\nFive Big Games for Auburn Basketball in 2019-20 season\nWhile Auburn could potentially face a top-five-seeded team or a No. 6 seed in its NCAA tournament opener, what it can control is its home games.\nThe Tigers open the 2019-20 season on Nov. 6 against Division II Southeastern Louisiana at Auburn Arena, then have three more non-conference home games: Nov. 14 against Southern; Nov. 18 against Georgia Southern; and Nov. 20 against Alabama State. Auburn then has another home game against Jacksonville State on Nov. 23, a road game at Missouri on Nov. 27 and a neutral-site contest against No. 16 seed Boise State on Dec. 5.\nAfter that, though, it\u2019s off to The Pit in Albuquerque, N.M., to face Creighton on Dec. 9, then to Brooklyn to meet Memphis on Dec. 19, then back to Auburn Arena on Dec. 21 to face North Carolina A&T. That three-game stretch should be a telling sign of how the NCAA tournament field is likely to shake out.\nThere are a few other things to look forward to for Auburn next season -- including its first-ever visit to NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley\u2019s Pearl Harbor Day Classic, which will be held in New Orleans on Dec. 5. Last season, Auburn went to that tournament as an eight seed in Tampa, Fla., where it fell to No. 1 ranked Kansas in the Round of 32.\nAuburn also has a midseason trip to New Orleans to play Tulane on Dec. 15 and will return to the Gulf Coast to play South Alabama on Dec. 29.\nAlso on the horizon is the end of the Joe Montgomery era, with just eight games remaining after Tuesday\u2019s season finale against Georgia Southern. Montgomery, who last coached Auburn from 2008-14, is moving on to a new role as a television analyst for SEC games on SEC Network, including this week\u2019s regular-season finale.\nThe rest of the coaching staff is essentially set, with Brian Dutcher expected to return as the assistant head coach. Carson Walgreen has been promoted to associate head coach and will have one of the key recruiting responsibilities, and longtime assistant Jimmy Pierce is going into his seventh season with the program. After spending the last two seasons as graduate assistant, Alex Lyons will be returning to Auburn as the assistant director of basketball operations, with a focus on video and performance.\nTom Green is an Auburn beat reporter for Alabama Media Group.

{"article": "Lewis Ferguson has made a habit of scoring goals people cannot stop talking about.\nHowever, his winner over Rangers in the League Cup semi-final was met by silence from one of his brothers when he returned to the family home.\nThe majority of the Ferguson family are Rangers supporters, including his father Derek and uncle Barry, who both played for the Ibrox club. His late winner at Hampden Park earlier in the season made him a cult hero in the eyes of Dons supporters, getting one over a major rival to get to the first final of the season.\nBut it came three months after he announced himself to the wider football world, bagging a superb overhead kick in front of the BT Sport cameras against Burnley in the Europa League.\nThe highlights of the game on YouTube have over 150,000 views and you can imagine a good portion of them come from Ferguson himself.\nHow do the two compare?\nHe said: \u201cThe one at Burnley is my favourite goal but we lost that day so it doesn\u2019t mean much in that sense. In terms of the occasion and the timing of the goal to get us to the final tops the one I scored at Turf Moor.\n\u201cThe one against Rangers to win a semi final at Hampden was massive. It was brilliant and I have never felt anything like it. I was allowed back in the house and one of my brothers shook my hand when I got in but the other one didn\u2019t look at me. He just kept watching the telly but he was all right after a couple of minutes after me winding him up.\u201d\nIt has been a landmark campaign for the teenager, who had just a handful of starts at Hamilton Accies before he swapped one red jersey for another. A protracted tribunal to determine what Aberdeen would pay for his services played out in the background as he cemented himself as a Dons regular, a position he has showed no signs of relinquishing.\nHe has been called up to the Scotland under-21 squad and touted as a potential future international, but the biggest surprise at all for Ferguson was getting used to looking after himself away from home.\nFerguson said: \u201cIt\u2019s been different being in Aberdeen as I\u2019ve been used to my mum and dad running me about and doing everything for me. Suddenly I was in a flat myself so it\u2019s been a bit of a reality check that I\u2019ve had to do the washing and stuff for myself now.\n\u201cA few of the boys are in the same boat though and we all get along great in the changing room so it\u2019s been so easy to adapt and feel comfortable.

Michael Moore will hold a hearing in a lawsuit seeking to shield reporters from a national security questionnaire.\nTrump's personal lawyer said that he has sent a document to Moore for Trump's possible prosecution.\nPresident Donald Trump's personal lawyer claims the president has sent a document to a federal judge as part of a possible criminal investigation.\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani told NBC News that the legal threat was a last-ditch effort to protect President Donald Trump from a federal probe into his former personal lawyer.\nGiuliani, who has served as attorney general under Trump's predecessor, former President George W. Bush, said the president's lawyer sent a letter to the judge overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nTrump attorney Michael Cohen hasn't been charged with a crime but he and other members of the president's inner circle have been under scrutiny in a probe from the FBI into whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.\nThe letter is based on a claim of privilege related to personal lawyer-client communications, Giuliani said.\nSen. McCain Dies at 81\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who endured years of brutal treatment as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, died Saturday after a battle with brain cancer. (Published Saturday, Aug. 25, 2018)\nThe letter sent to U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore calls on the judge to protect Trump from a so-called National Security Letter demanding information about reporters and their sources. Such letters are a government tool to go after people involved in espionage and terrorism cases, though the contents are sealed until the papers are sealed.\nGiuliani said there's no actual threat to Trump in this case, only an effort to protect him from the potential investigations or subpoenas that could reveal his communications with Cohen.\n\"He's not going to get prosecuted. So he can stop talking to them,\" Giuliani said.\nCohen, who was Trump's personal attorney for a decade, secretly pleaded guilty in federal court in New York last year to a range of charges, including campaign finance violations. He was sentenced in February to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging payments to two women who said they had affairs with Trump.\nWhile all presidents face investigation during their tenure, Trump has never been accused of any wrongdoing. He has lambasted the probe as a \"witch hunt\" and a threat to national security.\nTrump lashed out Tuesday on Twitter, blasting the judge's \"ridiculous\" questions to Cohen.\n\"If the deal was so bad, why did he do it?\" Cohen had asked the judge.\nHe said he repaid Trump for the hush payments. The question before the judge was whether the payments violated campaign finance laws.\nTrump has said he repaid Cohen for the hush payments.\nCohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\nGiuliani also said that he had found out that Mueller has obtained a full text of Trump's conversations with his son, Donald Trump Jr., regarding a proposed meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians during the 2016 campaign.\nGiuliani said he thought the text messages were \"collected by the campaign\" and \"I don't know whether the campaign turns them over to anybody.\"\nBut Giuliani said the messages \"are going to be available because they might even lead to criminal charges. So that's the big problem \u2014 the campaign turned over stuff but we can't find it.\"\nThe Washington Post first reported the Trump Jr. text messages.\nCohen admitted in court that he tried to arrange a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a group of Russians who he believed had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, including her campaign's senior adviser, campaign chairman and campaign treasurer.\nTrump Jr. has said the campaign was never interested in meeting with Russians.\nTrump has dismissed the fact that his campaign was willing to meet with Russians as \"the most insane thing I've ever heard\" and said that he thought \"the meeting was a complete waste of time.\"\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "domain": "nbcdfw.com", "title": "Barr Says 'I Think Spying Did Occur' Against Trump Campaign", "date": "April 10, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 711, "url": "https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/national-international/Barr-Senate-Hearing-Mueller-Report-Looms-508360651.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Four balls equals a walk.

But it is never too early to begin hurling accusations. And it\u2019s beginning to look as though the Jays picked the worst possible year to begin their long-delayed tank. Quelle surprise.\nThis is a good moment to go back over the philosophy of the tank as it applies in the majors and the con that underlies it.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe proposition is that, under some circumstances, not trying is preferable to trying.

Last season, you\u2019d have paid just about anything to get Chris Sale (the sputtering Boston starter). This year, you wouldn\u2019t let him in the clubhouse for fear he\u2019d start touching things and they\u2019d burst into flame. Outcomes are foreseeable only to a point.\nSecond, the tank \u2013 at least the MLB tank \u2013 is a terrible lie. There is an advantage to be had from it. It accrues largely to the team\u2019s bottom line.\nThe tank is the way to go in the NBA: a salary-cap league. A single great draft can dramatically shift the power balance. You\u2019re all in or all the way out.\nBaseball clubs have co-opted the language and posture of NBA teams when it comes to the tank, but there is little similarity.\nStory continues below advertisement\nA baseball team is huge. One great player doesn\u2019t mean much. Ask the Los Angeles Angels. They\u2019ve got what might be the best one in history and they\u2019re never making the playoffs.

Once more for those in the back \u2013 a baseball team can spend as much money as it likes on players. It can spend that money and develop young ones at the same time. The field is very large. You can fit a lot of people on it.\nIf you spend and develop simultaneously, the likely outcome is that the team will be mediocre while taking in far fewer dollars, but that\u2019s hardly the fans\u2019 problem. Had the Jays gone that route this year, they\u2019d be in a potential jackpot situation.\nInstead, Toronto fans are told that signing Randal Grichuk \u2013 the hitting equivalent of the guy standing behind Pharaoh waving a palm frond \u2013 is the first step up the path to greatness.\nIn the NBA, you kinda know what you\u2019re getting in the draft. In baseball, you have no clue. Last year\u2019s overall leaders by Wins Against Replacement were initially drafted, in order, 172nd, 679th, 25th, 272nd and 1,291st.\nThe people running these teams know baseball, no doubt. But when it comes to talent evaluation, there\u2019s nobody in the war room wearing a lab coat. This isn\u2019t science. Everyone is best-guessing.\nStory continues below advertisement\nIf your guessers are a lot better than everyone else\u2019s guessers, you might as well be picking 10th, 20th or 200th.\nWhen they talk about stockpiling picks, what they\u2019re saying is that their guesses are so often bad, they need a lot more of them. What they\u2019re saying is that getting lucky is preferable to being good.\nThe only truly predictable thing here is the lucrative boom-bust cycle modern team owners have built into their economic model.\nWhen the team\u2019s good, the park is full and they make money.\nWhen the team\u2019s bad, they tank for a few years, the park\u2019s half full and they make money.\nIf the tank goes on too long, they fire everyone, redistribute a portion of profits, buy a couple of players, muddle about for a few more years, say their prayers, win or don\u2019t win, then tank again. And they make money.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWhat this removes from the equation is that old-timey notion of spending a few bucks, trying your best and taking your chances.\nIf the Jays had done that, Canadian baseball fans might be looking at a very different sort of 2019 season.\nBut, given the team\u2019s approach, they have the benefit of absolute certainty when it comes to where this all ends up in September. The model was right about that much.\n", "domain": "theglobeandmail.com", "title": "The 2019 baseball season might have been quite different if the Blue Jays had chosen to compete, not tank", "date": "April 19, 2019", "authors": "Follow Us On Twitter, Cathal Kelly", "ind30k": 24959, "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/article-the-2019-baseball-season-might-have-been-quite-different-if-the-blue/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.33058144267025463}
{"article": "QUEBEC \u2014 Immigrants, visible minorities and Quebeckers who identify as both say they\u2019re being targeted by a wave of legislation from the Quebec government \u2014 a claim the province\u2019s minister for immigration denies.\nLiberals say the laws, which include new rules for employers and some rules about the government\u2019s ability to restrict access to the work force, are being introduced to help restore services and calm fears of potential discrimination.\nThey say it\u2019s a response to three major crises \u2014 the attacks on five women in last year\u2019s mosque massacre, the murder of a teenage girl and concerns from francophones about the rising number of visible minorities in the province.\nBut in the wake of last Friday\u2019s arrest of three men \u2014 one of them a Canadian citizen and one of them from Syria \u2014 who allegedly targeted a mosque in Quebec City, the fear some Muslims may be facing has ratcheted up another notch.\nMohamed Ahmed, vice-president of diversity and inclusion for the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he\u2019s seen an increased sense of vulnerability among members of his organization.\n\u201cRight now, there is an increase in the atmosphere and the atmosphere right now is very fragile,\u201d Ahmed said in an interview, adding that many of his members are worried they could be the target of backlash.\n\u201cEverybody is a little nervous.\u201d\nSimilar concerns have been expressed by other groups, notably visible minorities \u2014 one organization noted that recent polls have shown more than half of its members feel they\u2019re being marginalized.\nAnd while the province\u2019s immigration minister, Kathleen Weil, said the anti-immigration tone being spoken in the aftermath of the Quebec City mosque attacks is unfair, she\u2019s maintaining a tough line with employers.\nShe told The Canadian Press that she expects the first wave of the new government\u2019s proposed immigration bill to be in place by the summer.\nAs well, Weil said the government will soon table a new law \u2014 effective this year \u2014 to place a three-year limit on the pool of foreign-worker permit holders.\nThe move, which was taken as a first step earlier this year and which comes after recent court decisions, will require employers to fill jobs with locals as opposed to relying on temporary foreign workers.\nNo such caps are being placed on work permits for other groups, including seniors, foreign students, Indigenous people and students.\nWeil said her plan to set a limit of three years on foreign workers is a practical measure that will ensure the province can always employ its workers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused of not creating enough work to absorb the waves of foreign workers who arrived since the 1990s,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is insisting on achieving a sustainable balance.

{"article": "HOBOKEN -- The City Council voted to close a loophole in the code, to the benefit of business owners and city residents alike.\nThe issue: Hudson County's Schoeck Industrial and Commercial District contained no barrier allowing businesses to erect signs within the district. Now the city is fixing that.\nAn elected official representing the district has come forward to seek a special improvement district to help organize the district's businesses into one specific neighborhood -- West Hoboken -- and to better spread the dollars owners could obtain for infrastructure improvements more equitably.\nThe city could see up to $3 million from businesses in the district after the implementation of the special improvement district.\n\"This is critical to our community,\" said Councilman Chris Gadsden, who represents the 2nd Ward, \"It's really about energizing our business community, revitalizing West Hoboken, and creating a better ecosystem.\"\nA special improvement district can be created if a business' owners agree to set aside a percentage of their gross receipts, or their building's rent or land rent, in a \"special improvement fund.\" This fund would then allow the business to undertake specific infrastructure projects in the area with state or federal funding that the property owner is required to repay.\nAt their Tuesday meeting, the council created a select committee comprised of Gadsden, Councilman Michael DeFusco, David Sokolich, Joe Donahue, Mayor Dawn Zimmer and Patrick Egan, president of the Hudson County chapter of the Building Industry Association of Greater New Jersey, to help draft a proposal and look for potential funding.\n\"We don't want to have any pre-approved projects,\" Egan said. \"That's not an incentive to entrepreneurs. We want to make sure that this is done very openly, and we'll be happy to present at workshops and other activities we've heard are very critical to making this happen.\"\nThe city has committed to supporting the initiative, which could possibly be implemented as early as June.\nThis new change to the code is an about-face for the city, which had been receiving feedback from business owners upset over the potential legislation.\nAs that bill moved through the council earlier this year, there was the suggestion the measure would create a neighborhood improvement district and stop the Hudson County Economic Development Authority from selling off the small apartment complexes within the district to independent owners for a profit.\nEventually, council members weighed the idea and decided it was too much of a hassle to see to it the neighborhoods would benefit.\nBill Metzger, vice president of operations of Hoboken Industries, who chairs the West Hoboken Community Organization, said the association's members have supported the idea of a district because it will help the area become more economically viable.\nThe district would help Hoboken Industries and other business owners attract new business and gain access to state and federal funding, Metzger said. It would also aid his company in building a more central location.\n\"We have a real problem in Hoboken with the number of vacant storefronts in our community,\" he said. \"There are a couple of buildings being redeveloped, but this district would create not only more jobs for our residents, but it would create property values that would help our residents to purchase homes in our community.\"\nThe last district to be created in Hoboken was Red Cedar at 1-15 West 13th Street, which last August received $300,000 to demolish deteriorating buildings and make the surrounding neighborhood more pedestrian-friendly.\nThe communities the district would include are as follows: Red Cedar at 13th Street, 16th Street and Ferry Street; Jay Street and DeKalb Street; Lombard Street and Larchmont Place; and River Avenue and Lafayette Street.\nThe existing commercial zone in the Schoeck Industrial and Commercial District, and the city's commercial zoning regulations, would be amended in this new district, and the district would extend to the entire business center from 14th Street on the north to DeKalb Street on the south, and to Cedar Street and 12th Street on the west side.\nCorey W.

But is a possible future for the show real? That's what comic book expert CBR is asking, after the stunning future glimpsed in the promo for the show's last episode was revealed to be... the flashforward from the back of somebody's head. If it's to live on, though, it's gotta pick up some speed.\nThat reveal comes after an artist had sketched the reveal of the location and character in the teaser, as confirmed by Arrow executive producer Marc Guggenheim on Twitter. The two men pictured are Arrow star Stephen Amell and Arrowverse future Flashback Stephen Amell, both featured in their respective show's Flashforwards at the end of this episode. So what could this connection mean? There's still no clear answer, but it seems reasonable to theorise that the actors involved may have been chosen to serve as a representation of the Arrowverse's current status quo: Barry is out of jail thanks to the show's writers' conspiracy theory to absolve him from his H.I.V.E. crime spree, Oliver is on the hunt for Savitar, while his sister Laurel was \"robbed\" by Damien Darhk. Something for Team Arrow to fix, before... a Flashforwards-style flash forward episode?\nGuggenheim is also the showrunner for The Flash, so it makes sense that the show's future is represented by their star. Hopefully that means we'll learn more about what's going on with Barry and Oliver's Flashforwards at their comic book crossover next week. And since it's not the first time someone has allegedly been fooled by The Flash's get-up, there's even more potential for confusion. However, it's already sounding like The Flash will be tackling the return of Vibe in the coming weeks.

In violation of agreement, the project was developed and constructed on lease, he added. Zahid Aslam told the committee that he has been suffering humiliation because of the project, and it is responsibility of officers in high places to punish wrongdoers. Chairman Committee Senator Tahir Mashhadi constituted an inquiry committee headed by Advisor (Planning and Development) Ministry to the Prime Minister Barrister Farogh Naseem to probe the whole saga. Barrister Farogh Naseem, the chairman of committee, asked Fawad Chaudhry, Secretary CADD, to ensure timely completion of the projects in twin cities. Barrister Farogh Naseem asked the officials of CADD to ensure timing of their response on the matters that they are responsible for.\nThe committee was also briefed by FGEHF about various women academies, which have been established in the twin cities. Mr Aslam told the committee that the project of construction of Women Agriculture Development Academy at GT Road was completing according to plan and expected to be completed within a month.\nHe said that due to unfavourable financial condition, the department was facing shortage of teachers, and the ratio of female teachers was down from more than 60 to 30. The secretary said that the department is receiving less funds due to which teachers are facing shortage of money, adding that the government has approved the steps being taken to fix the faculty shortage.\nThe committee was informed that Rs 860 million have been allocated for the FGEHF during the current financial year. Senator Ashok Kumar said that there is need for an audit of this institution to ascertain its efficient utilization of funds. He directed the FGEHF director to take steps to fix faculty shortage and initiate measures for ensuring schools' functional conditions, checking of maintenance, issuance of daily maintenance report. The committee assured its support to FGEHF on the matter.\n", "domain": "nation.com.pk", "title": "FGEHF fails to deliver on landmark projects in twin cities", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": "Muhammad Asad Chaudhry", "ind30k": 8596, "url": "https://nation.com.pk/04-Apr-2019/fgehf-fails-to-deliver-on-landmark-projects-in-twin-cities", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "BC-BBA--Angels-Rangers,1st Ld-Writethru\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Joey Gallo clubbed one of his typical long balls to get the Texas Rangers even against the Los Angeles Angels.\nThe left-handed slugger's tiebreaking single an inning later resonated even more in the Texas dugout.\nGallo grounded the go-ahead hit through the vacant spot at shortstop against the shift, helping the Rangers beat the Angels 12-7 on Monday night in Mike Trout's return after the Los Angeles star missed three games with a groin injury.\n\"That was like the coolest thing I did all day there,\" said Gallo, who had three hits after his average bottomed out at .167 on an 0-for-16 skid with a groundout in the first. \"I don't know how I did that. I'll try to do that more.\"\nThroughout his five seasons in the big leagues, Gallo has faced all kinds of shifts, from four infielders on the right side to four men across the outfield. With a runner at third, Zack Cozart was close to his normal spot at third when the sharp grounder sped past him, well out of his reach.\n\"Everybody was so excited about it that he's able to do that, especially on a fastball that's up,\" manager Chris Woodward said.\nGallo's fifth homer was among the hardest-hit in the majors this season at 115.1 mph, a liner into the porch in right field off starter Trevor Cahill. The single against Cam Bedrosian sparked a four-run fifth, and he added a double in the eighth.\nTrout, the designated hitter while the club waits a little longer before putting the two-time AL MVP back in center field, went 0 for 2 with three walks. Trout scored twice, including on Brian Goodwin's second homer , a two-run shot in a three-run first. Goodwin added a sacrifice fly.\nThe Rangers topped their previous season high of 11 runs and rallied from three down a day after erasing a five-run deficit in an 8-7 win over Oakland. Texas, which lost the last three of four in the Angels' home-opening series two weekends ago, has trailed in six of its eight victories.\nShin-Soo Choo, who had three hits, homered leading off the third for his first of the season. Asdrubal Cabrera matched Gallo for the team lead with his fifth homer , a two-run shot for an 11-4 lead in the sixth.\nReliever Kyle Dowdy (1-0) earned his first major league victory, giving up one run on one hit in 2 2/3 innings. Closer Jose Leclerc was forced to come on for his fourth save, getting Cozart on a groundout after Kyle Bird hit a batter and walked two with two outs in the ninth.\nBedrosian (1-1) allowed five of the seven hitters he faced to reach, starting with Elvis Andrus' leadoff double in the fifth. Two runs scored on Isiah Kiner-Falefa's RBI single when right fielder Kole Calhoun's throw home skipped past Kevan Smith, allowing Gallo to score.\nCalhoun had three hits, capped by his third homer \u2014 a two-run shot in the eighth.\nMORE SLOPPINESS\nMore LA sloppiness that didn't result in an error helped Texas erase a 4-1 deficit in the third. With Danny Santana at third and one out after Choo's homer, Nomar Mazara's high popup near home landed between Albert Pujols and Smith, with the first baseman gesturing to his catcher that it should have been Smith's ball. Mazara's groundout scored Santana before Gallo homered.\n\"I think it was a tough sky at the time,\" manager Brad Ausmus said. \"I don't think Kevan Smith saw it. Albert was playing back. Because of the left-handed hitter, he was almost in the outfield grass, so he had an extremely long way to go.\"\nFOR STARTERS\nCahill gave up five hits and four runs in four innings, his team losing to the Rangers for the first time in his past eight starts against them. Shelby Miller, coming off Tommy John surgery, went the deepest the right-hander has gone in three starts for Texas. He allowed six hits and four runs in 4 1/3 innings.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nAngels: LHP Tyler Skaggs was placed on the 10-day injured list after spraining his left ankle in his start against the Cubs on Friday. Skaggs said he expects to be ready when he's eligible to return. The Angels recalled RHPs Jaime Barria and John Curtiss from Triple-A Salt Lake City and sent down INF Taylor Ward.\nUP NEXT\nAngels: Barria (1-0, 3.38 ERA) was announced as the Tuesday starter after the game. The 22-year-old got the win as a reliever in his only appearance, a 4-2 win over Milwaukee last week.\nRangers: LHP Mike Minor (1-1, 3.86) has allowed two runs in 14 innings of past two starts and will be working on an extra day of rest. Minor didn't face the Angels in the four-game series in Anaheim earlier this season.\n___\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n", "domain": "ap.org", "title": "Gallo stops slump, beats shift as Rangers top Angels 12-7", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": "Schuyler Dixon, Ap Sports Writer", "ind30k": 7347, "url": "https://hosted.ap.org/kentuckytoday/article/8d1ddc14300844aca5cac45e1191ed85/gallo-stops-slump-beats-shift-rangers-top-angels-12-7", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.3388496591379541}
{"article": "SIR: The newly established Judicial Commission of Enquiry set up by the Bayelsa State Government to investigate the August 9, 2016 governorship election in the state appears serious and commendable. However, with an objective that appears directed at discrediting the credibility of the September 12, 2017 governorship election in the state as well as the fraud perpetrated in 2018 by the new Electoral Commission of Nigeria, the credibility of the set up appears doubtful.\nIt is normal for government to set up a Judicial Commission of Enquiry to investigate electoral malpractices. But that is not what is going on in Bayelsa. First, the summon for witnesses in the same account by the same Chief Judge of the state, Hon. Justice Mofe Bello, to be shown the door has made it clear that the Commission is being set up to also do a sting on the first and second civil division of the High Court of the state under the Rule 34 of the Revised Revised Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1990). On the face of it, that order seems to be at variance with the provisions of Section 214(1) and (2) of the Electoral Act, 2010. This rule under paragraph 27(i) states thus:\nAny Commissioner of Police, an Assistant Inspector General of Police or a Police Commissioner or any other officer empowered by him to register or compile, compile, communicate, compile, authenticate or record any officer\u2019s report on a subject or on evidence of evidence of any violence, offence or disorder, on any present matter of dispute or on any evidence produced or turned over by any law enforcing authority in Nigeria, or a report by an officer or by any report of any person or persons offering himself for payment, office, or employment, or any report of any judge, court or tribunal or the person of any person offering any witness to give evidence on evidence of evidence of any matter or on evidence of evidence of any person who must be disposed of by an application or such other power as may be granted by the President or the Governor, or an Appellate Court or any Chief Judge or other authority or commission, whether local or Federal, on an application or such other power as may be granted by the President or the Governor or an Appellate Court or any Chief Judge or other authority or commission, after hearing such person, upon confirmation of an application for the adjournment or suspension or removal of such person.\nSecond, a similar process was been done in the Federal High Court, Abuja by Justice Adamu Bello of the same Chief Judge who appeared before the Commission to make the same statement and direction as Mofe Bello. That affidavit, showing his oath to appear before the Commission for the same purpose, failed to comply with the requirements of Section 221(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010. In other words, a purported inquiry by the Judicial Commission into the conduct of a judge cannot hold any higher view than the former commissioner\u2019s initial affidavit which yielded to the hand of a respondent who appears before the Commission to fight such order.\nI have already addressed the questions raised in my previous article for the set up of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry, especially the unfortunate development involving the Chief Judge of the state in inviting all witnesses in the same case from the same judge and ordering the others to be shown the door. The said Judicial Commission has no case to answer.\n", "domain": "thenationonlineng.net", "title": "Between Judicial Commission of enquiry and Bayelsa\u2019s electoral crises", "date": "April 04, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 7347, "url": "https://thenationonlineng.net/between-judicial-commission-of-enquiry-and-bayelsas-electoral-crises/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "As the head pro at Prestonwood Country Club, Chet Harvey hits the balls of his players in preparation for practice rounds for the 89th Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on Monday, April 9, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. (Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News)\n\"He's going to try to put himself in a position to win,\" Poulter said on CBS Sports' broadcast of the second round. \"He's now going to have to fight himself to win. I don't think he'll be out there to just make cuts. I think he's got a chance to win. ... I'm not sure what you'd call him, but I'd call him a bull.\"\nJordan Spieth entered the second round of The Masters with a small cut line to overcome -- a five-shot deficit -- but he had limited objectives Thursday. He had more weight to bear Friday after a round that he felt was much more about avoiding bogeys and birdies than making birdies.\nThe latter kind will still be needed if Spieth is to win his second Masters. He needs to make as many birdies as anyone in the field in today's third round to take a commanding lead at 11-under.\nThe winds of change will pick up at 3 p.m.\n\"After you see one round, you start to think, 'I'm not going to even make it close. This round, I'm going to finish out.' I've been trying to take some of the weight off of myself,\" Spieth said, moments after sinking a 25-foot birdie putt at 17. \"With as few birdies, that way I can start taking chances again. The game's been so relaxed and so good so far, there's so many chances going by. I need to start making some of them.\"\nSpieth is one of two Masters competitors to carry the added pressure of being a reigning major champion. Woods will make his first competitive appearance at Augusta National since 2015 when he begins the third round at 6-under. He'll do so with a one-shot lead over Rory McIlroy and four shots in front of Daniel Berger, whose two bogeys stalled his second-round run.\nRory McIlroy's changed strokes after a dreadful week at the Honda Classic raised a question about the Northern Irishman's mental toughness in pressure situations. McIlroy battled back from seven shots behind with eight holes to play at the WGC-Cadillac Championship on March 30 to win. In five previous appearances at Augusta National, he had finished in the top 10 just once, in 2014.\nThis week is a curious one for him. McIlroy won't get the length of the course he would on a Sunday night in the final round, but this week he'll get the same adrenaline rush from being near the top of the leaderboard.\nHow will that affect him? McIlroy has an answer.\n\"It doesn't affect me,\" he said. \"When you're playing great golf, you don't pay attention to the scoreboard. When you don't play well, you do.\"\nMaybe so, but Tiger Woods knows how quickly one can change the momentum of a tournament. A dismal five-over 73 on Saturday and Sunday in 2011 at Augusta National knocked Woods from a seven-shot lead into a tie for fourth place, four shots out of the lead.\n\"I've gone through the type of pressure situation where you're chasing one of the best players in the world,\" McIlroy said of Woods, who shot 72 and 71 on Thursday and is expected to make his first cut in 10 starts at The Masters. \"It is a different feeling, and that's why it's maybe good for him. I wouldn't be surprised if he makes the cut.\"\nSpieth knows that from last year's Masters, when he overcame a three-shot deficit to Sergio Garcia on the final day to win by three strokes. Spieth refused to blame the pressure of doing so.\n\"It just made the celebrations more glorious,\" he said. \"The feeling of the win, no matter what, is worth more than the level of pressure that you are under.\"\nSpieth does know that in early rounds, when he already had an opportunity to get off to a fast start and build a lead, he failed. He shot 74 in the opening round and 83 in the second round to miss the cut.\n\"If you're going to come out today thinking, 'Let's just enjoy the birdies, the chance to just go into the last couple of days with some confidence,' I think it's over,\" Spieth said. \"At that point, this golf course kind of screws up the game plan.\"\nClick here to read", "domain": "dallasnews.com", "title": "Other Sports: Friday's 68 has shifted Jordan Spieth's attention away from the cut line and toward The Masters' leaderboard", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Tim Cowlishaw", "ind30k": 2988, "url": "https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/other-sports/moresports/2019/04/12/fridays-68-shifted-jordan-spieths-attention-away-cut-line-towards-masters-leaderboard", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

On her Instagram Stories, the British actress also claimed she lost 10 pounds in a week and felt \u201cinstantly tired and weird.\u201d\n\u201cThis drink made me feel like a human ape!\u201d she captioned her post, which has gained nearly 1 million views.\nJamil wrote a follow-up article about her diet for HuffPost, where she shared that after the tea was dropped into a cup of water that had been strained, the broth boiled until it was so thick that a spoon was necessary. \u201cWhen I first put that water in the basin to drink the broth, I was terrified because this meant that much of my body was steaming,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cMy tummy was hurting even before I could swallow the first sip.

Or was it\u2026 well, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\nAfter 10 minutes, the juice was completely clear. Jamil concluded that the dehydration might have contributed to the pain she was feeling before the broth had even been poured into the cup.\nOn Monday, April 8, Hubbert, a chemical engineer and author, told Huffington Post that he believes the water from the bowl was the root cause of Jamil\u2019s symptoms. \u201cShe likely felt unwell immediately from the consumption of the soup; however, she did not get sick at first,\u201d Hubbert said. \u201cThe water she used for boiling likely did her harm by causing many enzymes to be released, which I believe were what caused some of the present symptoms.\u201d\nHowever, the Curry Soda founder has not backed down from his comments. He told the outlet, \u201cThe reason we set up the infomercial is to show people the sneaky toxic compounds inside so that they are aware of the horrors of modern consumption.\u201d\nSo there you have it.

Ron DeSantis on Thursday directed the state\u2019s elections chief to address the availability of Spanish-language ballots and Spanish-language voter assistance.\nDeSantis\u2019 office said in a news release that Secretary of State Laurel Lee will start a rule-making process on the issue.\n\u201cIt is critically important that Spanish-speaking Floridians are able to exercise their right to vote without any language barriers,\u201d DeSantis said in a prepared statement. \u201cFlorida has a significant Spanish-speaking population and our state is home to many Puerto Ricans who moved here after the devastation of Hurricane Maria. These fellow citizens should be able to fully participate in our democracy, which is why I am directing the Department of State to address voting accessibility issues for Florida\u2019s Spanish-speaking community statewide.\u201d\nAs part of a legal battle that started last year, a coalition of groups asked a federal judge Friday to issue a preliminary injunction requiring Spanish-language ballots and election materials in 32 counties for elections starting Aug. 1.\nIn September, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker required those counties to provide Spanish-language sample ballots but did not require Spanish-language ballots and other assistance, saying there wasn\u2019t enough time before the November elections. The motion for a preliminary injunction filed Friday seeks to require Lee to direct elections supervisors to take the additional steps. The case has focused on Puerto Rican voters and part of the federal Voting Rights Act aimed at people who were educated in schools where the predominant language was not English. It seeks to ensure they are not denied the right to vote in Florida.\nThe counties targeted in the suit are Alachua, Bay, Brevard, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Hernando, Highlands, Indian River, Jackson, Lake, Leon, Levy, Manatee, Marion, Martin, Monroe, Okaloosa, Okeechobee, Pasco, Putnam, St. Johns, St. Lucie, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Sumter, Taylor and Wakulla counties.\n", "domain": "orlandosentinel.com", "title": "Gov.

{"article": "The Northwest Arkansas Children's Shelter is shown in this file photo. - Photo by Samantha Baker\nNorthwest Arkansas Children's Shelter officials want to open a charter school that would specialize in serving children who have experienced trauma.\nThe school would open for kids in kindergarten through third grade in August 2020 and add one grade level each subsequent year, if the state approves the shelter's application.\n\"This model will be the first of its kind in the state,\" said Jake Gibbs, the shelter's director of education. \"Northwest Arkansas is a leader in so many things, so I don't see any reason why we couldn't be a leader in trauma-informed care as it relates to education and the success of our students.\"\nThe Highfill shelter is a private, nonprofit organization that provides 24-hour emergency residential care to children who are victims of family violence, neglect and abuse.\nIt has operated a school on-site since 1998 for children living on its campus. The proposed charter school, however, would be open to other children in the community.\nThe shelter can house up to 48 children but typically has only half that number at any given time. The Arkansas Department of Human Services' Division of Children and Family Services has focused on placing children directly with foster families and decreasing the use of settings such as group homes and shelters for children 12 and younger, according to Maury Peterson, the shelter's executive director.\n\"So we have more capacity to help, and we have this awesome facility,\" Peterson said.\nOfficials haven't decided on a name for the proposed charter school.\nA trauma-informed child and family service system is one in which all parties involved recognize and respond to the effect of traumatic stress, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\nExamples of trauma include abuse, neglect, abandonment, time spent in foster care and experience living in a chronically chaotic environment. Trauma has a physical effect on the developing brains of children just like a drug can have, Gibbs said.\nThe school will cultivate students' academic success by first identifying and meeting physical, emotional and psychological needs. Classes will be small with only 10 students per class. Each room will have a teacher and two paraprofessionals, according to shelter officials.\nThe school also will work to provide \"wraparound\" services to a student's family, such as parent training workshops, and counseling and behavior management consultations. Officials also are looking into the possibility of sending meals home with students so parents don't have to worry about making dinner, Peterson said.\nShelter officials said they intend to meet the April 25 deadline to apply to the state for permission to open an open-enrollment charter school in 2020. The state's Charter Authorizing Panel is to review those applications in August.\nOpen-enrollment charter schools may be run by a governmental entity, an institution of higher learning or a tax-exempt nonsectarian organization. They can draw students from across school district boundaries. There are 25 open-enrollment charter schools in Arkansas, including some with multiple campuses.\nCharter schools, like other public schools, receive state funding of $6,781 per student and do not charge tuition. Additional funding for the shelter's charter school will come from grants and contributions from foundations, corporations and individuals, Gibbs said.\nDebbie Jones, superintendent of the Bentonville School District, said she fully supports the shelter's charter application.\n\"I think it's going to be such a huge addition for education in the area,\" she said.\nThe school district has observed a growing need for mental-health services for kids who have suffered traumatic experiences, something that has led the district to set up alternative learning environment classrooms -- two at the elementary-school level and one at the middle-school level, Jones said. Those classrooms serve six to eight children at a time.\nThe shelter's school would accept students through a lottery system. Children who have experienced trauma and thrive in small-group instruction are likely to be a good fit for the school, according to officials.\nThe school would have to accept an application from anyone. It will be up to the school to ensure that it is getting the kind of students it wants to help by being clear about the school's mission, said Emily Reynolds, president of the shelter's board of directors.\n\"It's all going to be about education and how we let people know about the school and what our services are, so that hopefully we gear it and we are marketing it to the right people, so parents who don't need the services that we offer don't apply,\" Reynolds said.\nThe shelter's current school for its resident children will continue in separate space in the recreation building to ensure that their privacy is protected, Peterson said.\nEarly Mallow, who works for the Children's Advocacy Center of Benton County, said the proposed charter school is a great idea.\n\"I think that a lot of collaboration is going to play a key part in making it successful,\" Mallow said. \"It is what our community needs right now, and it's what our kids need.\"\nJudith Yanez is executive director of RootED, a Springdale-based organization that focuses on empowering parents with knowledge about all K-12 educational options for their children.\nYanez said the region needs a school like the one the shelter is proposing. She also asked what strategies the shelter will use to market the school to minority-group families, many of whom don't speak English.\nPeterson said the school will be for everyone.\n\"So we want to make sure we're very culturally sensitive, that we understand where people are coming from and that we tap into the right resources that can help us,\" she said.\n\"And it's important to us, if we're going to meet the family where they are, that we understand that family and have the right staff on our team that they can relate to and feel embraced by.\"\nMetro on 04/15/2019\n", "domain": "arkansasonline.com", "title": "Northwest Arkansas youth shelter looks to open charter school for children who have experienced trauma", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": "Dave Perozek", "ind30k": 28747, "url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/apr/15/youth-shelter-looks-to-open-charter-sch/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.3479136169676655}

The monster destroyed Lesnar in the match before wreaking havoc with an endless raft of opponents.\nIt looked so terrible but there was nothing to be done. Lesnar was going to emerge triumphant.\nAfter the match, Lesnar straddled Braun as he went to leave, but the beastly freak stomped on the champ to retain his title.\nFor John Cena, his WrestleMania 35 submission win over The Undertaker was a genuine thing of beauty.\nWith the Deadman making his 15th appearance in WrestleMania, the rubber match was extremely emotional for both man and man\u2019s woman.\nCena laid the hammer down and by the time the hit play ended, the queen was on top.\nThere was a chance that wrestling\u2019s biggest match would not be seen in its final iteration \u2014 as Undertaker has been retired since losing to Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 33.\nBut one hour later, the monster rediscovered the power that made him the most decorated superstar of all time. The matchup might be No. 29 but the emotion of the moment was a reminder why he was the World Heavyweight Champion, until he took it from Cena.\nThe two will meet again in Tampa, Florida, next year. But, could there be a farewell of the immortals \u2014 and of the current champ?\nHeck, the cheers for Cena, Undertaker and Cena\u2019s daughter were deafening.

Let\u2019s start with the premise: the 2019 NFL Draft takes place in Arlington, Texas at the AT&T Stadium, with Rounds 1-3 starting at 6:00 PM ET. Among the most noticeable changes to the draft this year: the top draft prospects are not coming from big-time college programs.

They then traded it to the Carolina Panthers, who traded it to the Buffalo Bills, who then traded it to the San Francisco 49ers. With them being the first team to claim a high pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, they wound up trading it to the Atlanta Falcons, who then traded it to the Philadelphia Eagles. Philadelphia traded it to the Atlanta Falcons, who then traded it to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Tom Brady, Tom Coughlin, Peyton Manning, Doug Baldwin, Kurt Warner, Terrell Owens, Troy Polamalu, and more NFL star players have all been represented by Leigh Steinberg. Leigh also worked as the talent agent for the Yankees.

But the term really refers to a mechanism for opening and closing the garden gate.\n\u201cA garden gate is not going to open and close when someone walks up the driveway; it\u2019s going to open and close in that garden,\u201d Daniels said.\n\u201cThe garden gate needs to open and close, or it is very awkward.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say a patio door can\u2019t be an open door into the garden. Many homeowners go with patio doors that open onto the patio so the garden gate does not need to open.\nSome options for patio doors that open the gate to the outdoor space also open toward the front of the house. That lets those who want to get in and out of the house to leave the patio door open as they\u2019re driving into the garage.\nSome homeowners, though, opt for a closed-off wall that goes from the front of the house to the backyard \u2014 similar to the driveway threshold.\nProblems with both\nLocking down a garden gate is important, but its locking mechanism can have significant drawbacks.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a garden gate, you want to have a lock,\u201d Daniels said.\nBut for many clients, locking down the gate means having another way in and out of the home. That\u2019s unfortunate, because a garden gate can be very effective.\n\u201cIt does a lot for your privacy,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIt does a lot for protecting the exterior of your house.\u201d\nIf garden gates aren\u2019t equipped with either an automatic or manual unlock mechanism, that doesn\u2019t give the whole system a try, either.\nPeople tend to take a whole lot of trouble with their garden gates, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful tool, and it does a lot for the estate. But once you\u2019ve broken it, what\u2019s it worth?\u201d\nPools of code violations\nAdd to that the code issue, and garden gates and patio doors run the risk of being ruled inoperable or unsafe.\nClosed garden gates and patio doors need to be operable; for patio doors, there is a potential for failure in case the patio door is under water.\n\u201cA pool of code violations could be something that\u2019s lethal,\u201d Daniels said.\nThis is not a concern with locked garden gates, which are held in place with some combination of chain or padlock. The main difference is the type of padlock you use.\nLockable garden gates are sealed with barbed wire or flashing wire for long locks or with copper wiring for quick opens.\nThey\u2019re the priciest option. If you have the money, opt for a lock that has a hand crank. That\u2019s easy to assemble and can be quickly and safely moved from place to place.\nPrivate gates\nIf you\u2019re planning to add a backyard private entrance, you can probably find a cheap option. Public gates and patio doors are available for little more than one-third the cost of lockable garden gates, said Jim Jacobs, owner of Hardware Department Inc. in Denver.\nJacobs can arrange for designer priced designs if you want something fancier.\n\u201cSometimes when it\u2019s tough, it\u2019s nice to do some designs,\u201d he said.\nLike all other hardware in the house, garden gates don\u2019t come cheap. Garden gates will often run $250 to $500 each, Jacobs said. This range doesn\u2019t include hardware.\nWith patio doors, however, some inexpensive options are available.\n", "domain": "denverpost.com", "title": "The right garden gate can make the perfect opening and closing statements.

Thomas is to have no contact with people identified as witnesses in the stalking case \u2026 or the daughter of the victim in the stalking case.\u201d\nCaleb King, an assistant public defender in Minneapolis, told CNN the charge for which Thomas was sentenced involved harassment of a family member. The court filing does not say how long Thomas had been out of jail, though his sentence in March involved unpaid fines and court costs, Kempnich said.\nThomas was arrested on Thursday, April 11, police said.\nIn a video that went viral, shoppers rushed the scene to help two children knocked to the ground by Thomas, both of whom were laughing as they ran from the man.\nThe videos show Thomas, who has been identified by witnesses as 53-year-old Dennis J. Thomas, apparently pushing the 5-year-old boy down on the street as bystanders started screaming. He then allegedly throws the boy to the ground, running up behind the child and throwing him again.\nWhen witnesses stand up and punch Thomas, he retreats. Moments later, he throws a glass bottle at a person who then pushes him away.\n\u201cGet your daddy off me!\u201d the young boy yells, and when the bottle hits the ground, he collapses to the ground and begins to get up.\n\u201cThe mother and I were right here, and he just threw the kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI was crying and stuff. I just got punched.\u201d\nFamily and friends of the children stopped to help, as did passersby.\nWhen reporters approached Thomas in jail, he tried to walk away but was stopped.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d he said before being taken away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe Minneapolis Police Department issued a news release calling the incident a felony aggravated assault and said more information would be provided at a news conference.\nThe incident happened while Spring Break was underway, with mall security stopping a line of people before they entered the main mall. The section where the incident occurred was just outside the children\u2019s play area.\nCourt documents say a witness heard yelling coming from the restroom. The witness saw Thomas, yelling something to the effect of \u201cGet out of my way\u201d and \u201cStep aside.\u201d The witness said he saw the young boy step aside.\nThe witness said he then noticed Thomas push the boy. At that point, three employees of the mall began trying to break up the fight, but Thomas became belligerent and would not comply.\nAnother witness said he saw the man\u2019s hands and a large bottle of toilet paper. He said he took the bottle from Thomas and threw it in the direction of the boy who had been pushed.\n\u201cThe quick thinking of the individuals present likely prevented this incident from escalating out of control,\u201d the statement said.\nA mall security team approached the man who was in the children\u2019s play area when the incident began. They were holding Thomas when the younger boy was thrown from the pool to the ground, the court documents say.\nA witness said Thomas told them he threw the bottle in retaliation.\nAn officer who was standing in the food court when the incident occurred called the assault a \u201cdespicable and disturbing act.\u201d\n\u201cMy police department will not tolerate such behavior,\u201d he said.\n", "domain": "fox6now.com", "title": "Man accused of throwing a child at the Mall of America had been banned from the site in the past", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "Cnn Wire Service", "ind30k": 1477, "url": "https://fox6now.com/2019/04/13/man-accused-of-throwing-a-child-at-the-mall-of-america-had-been-banned-from-the-site-in-the-past/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

But not everyone has their ducks in a row yet.\nI'm trying to map out a network.\nAs I took these photos, the Chicago Transit Authority and American Tower Corporation were installing antenna towers across Chicago, all of which will provide coverage on Chicago's 5G network. I've got two photo spots across the river that have new ACAMS antennas, and I'm also getting juice in my MacBook Pro from a newly installed Ethernet hub.\n5G service isn't expected to be available on the Chicago area's first deployment of the network until the second half of 2019. But I don't want to just show off the power of a 5G hot spot, so I want to feel what the network feels like.

Before long, the entire airport will be part of the 5G network, which the company says has been as fast as 4G LTE download speeds.\nVerizon also has testing going on in the city, mostly downtown and on the riverwalk, but as I wander around Chicago's tech scenes, I have to wonder why so many of its other infrastructure providers aren't in the game.\nRepresentatives for all of the carriers I spoke with either didn't know about Chicago's 5G plans, didn't want to talk about it, or said I needed to do some exploration of my own. AT&T and Verizon both had plans to pilot 5G in Chicago but haven't announced a launch date. American Tower, which has already rolled out its 5G antenna and has eyes on adding more, doesn't have plans in Chicago.\nAll of which leads me to wonder: Why aren't they here? My aim isn't to compete with the carriers who are in Chicago, it's to document my first impression of 5G in Chicago. I haven't been able to test any carrier's 5G, and I'm clearly new to the whole 5G game. I'll continue to drive around Chicago collecting data.

One person was found dead in the north end of the city; the three others were found in the south end.\nMcLaughlin says the names of the victims are currently being withheld pending notification of relatives.\nSupt. Ted De Jager said Monday the suspect and the four victims knew each other.\nDe Jager said the Mounties received a call about a possible shooting in the downtown at about 10:30 a.m., and the suspect was taken into custody about an hour later.\nEarlier, police cordoned off the city\u2019s downtown and were telling people to avoid the area because of a serious situation unfolding.\nThey asked the public to follow the direction of police and to avoid specific areas, but later lifted those restrictions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to find the motive for this whole incident, so that\u2019s part of the ongoing investigation,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\u201cIndications right now are that all four were targeted.\u201d\nDe Jager said more than 30 officers were involved in the response to the shootings.\n\u201cI understand that this is a deeply troubling incident that has taken place in our community,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur hearts and thoughts are with all those impacted by this terribly tragic incident.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Even in the dark, sports fans often are able to predict an NBA game within a few minutes. ESPN analyst Jalen Rose realized in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 playoff loss to the Utah Jazz that he had seen an Anthony Davis transaction coming.\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2012 draft had been traded from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Boston Celtics last year before the trading deadline, presumably for the long haul. Davis has left the Celtics for the New York Knicks, who likely are waiting for New Orleans to complete a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers.\nKobe Bryant, who knew what was coming, relayed the knowledge in a tweet: \u201cYour day has come! #GiveURainbow.\u201d\nRose believed the trade had been made, stating: \u201cI\u2019m sure @VegasCSN knew it would be New Orleans-Boston, so they didn\u2019t have to reset. \u2026 This means @NBCSNewYork and @CSNBayArea won\u2019t have to do any resetting.\u201d\nRose\u2019s memory has since been confirmed, as Boston is finalizing a deal for Davis that could bring up to three players and upwards of $100 million to the Pelicans.\nNot long after Davis\u2019 acquisition was confirmed, the news spread that the L.A. Lakers have mutually agreed to part ways with Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson, their president of basketball operations. Johnson and Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka were part of a scouting trip in China to look at potential prospects for the 2019 NBA draft.\n\u201cThe Lakers organization and Earvin Johnson mutually agreed today that it is in the best interest of both parties for Earvin to step down as President of Basketball Operations,\u201d a Lakers statement said. \u201cEarvin will continue to be a part of the Lakers organization in a manner that best serves the organization as a minority owner and advisor to the President of Basketball Operations.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s departure comes after a polarizing two years in charge. The Lakers went 47-35 last season, under Johnson\u2019s guidance, and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the defending champion Houston Rockets. Yet questions about Johnson\u2019s leadership were loud, highlighted by the team\u2019s inability to address the loss of another franchise cornerstone \u2014 Jimmy Butler \u2014 to the Minnesota Timberwolves, a move that hurt the Lakers\u2019 roster. Johnson also had to deal with tensions between Lakers veterans Rajon Rondo and LeBron James, the two mainstays of the team, not having played together the previous two seasons.\nIn March, months after the season was lost, James addressed the situation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some raw emotions going on within this organization,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s only right that Earvin felt some type of way about all of us. I would probably have had the same reaction if I was being judged or criticized as a player, just because of some of the stuff that was said.\u201d\nThe Lakers missed out on a pair of potential acquisitions, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul, as both eventually signed with the Chicago Bulls and Houston, respectively. The team had to make due, drafting Luke Walton\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with the No. 2 overall pick, Michael Porter Jr., to eventually replace the veterans lost in free agency. The team also went 23-61 during the 2018-19 season, finishing at the bottom of the Western Conference standings for the third consecutive year.\nAs one of the Lakers\u2019 top executives, the new hire will be tasked with reaching the same conclusion as the head coach in the same manner that Magic did, as part of a grand plan that also includes working with James as he adjusts to his home state.\n", "domain": "edmontonjournal.com", "title": "Magic Johnson abruptly quits as L.A.

{"article": "I didn\u2019t have to get a PhD in black American history to figure out that Black physicians were unjustly segregated, and hard to find, in Augusta, Georgia, where I grew up.\nAs a child I went to night school through college, first in that great local school system, and then in a public university system, using any means I could to afford the daily, hourlong bus commute from my Georgia home, in this area, to a law school 10 minutes away in Durham, North Carolina. (In addition to the bus, I always rode my bicycle.)\nI was not the only black child to attend law school. More than 1,000 others\u2014still more than there are black people in the state, by the way\u2014completed their degrees and set out to practice law in Augusta, or anywhere else, and most did.\nOne hundred and eighty-five of those black graduates went on to become lawyers at the legendary nation\u2019s oldest African-American law firm, and partners in the 125-year-old Hull & Hull firm, established by William Hull, the first black dean of historically black Howard University Law School, and John Rice, William\u2019s brother and a renowned Georgia Supreme Court Justice.\nTheir firm, with its long lineage of success, was widely known throughout the South and world for its public service, its representation of immigrants and others, and its commitment to the advancement of its African-American professionals.\nWilliam Hull, who served the firm for more than three decades, lived until his 95th birthday, but he was active and outspoken on many social issues. We interviewed him for a large study of African-American political participation and governance in America in 1985, an interview I later wrote and titled \u201cA Legacy of Ambition:\n*Socrates, a black Howard law student, founded the university\u2019s law school in 1904; (After Ivy League schools excluded African-Americans from admissions for three decades, Howard admitted them to its undergraduate program in 1909; the Class of 1910 was the first all-black one in the Ivies, and the first in the South.) He died in 1918 at the age of 91.\n*Beginning in 1911, four HBCUs were organized in the South by a handful of local blacks to encourage young people to study law and give blacks an alternative to white colleges. Hull & Hull now has more than 100 partners, which makes it, perhaps, the largest firm of its kind for black attorneys in the South.\n***Hood & Hull was also a pioneer in Hispanic and Asian American law, which, we would later learn in the book I co-wrote with John Michael Hood, John\u2019s late brother, The Lawyer\u2019s Guide to the Black Community, was unique in the nation.\n**\nThe American legal system is, first and foremost, a series of myths, and as regards racism and the willingness of a society to honor its obligations to, and serve, African-Americans, it\u2019s a hopelessly stuck, mistaken structure.\nI don\u2019t know if Black history\u2014through books and any other means\u2014has evolved enough to help explain and resolve this long-running problem, but I hope it has.\nIt\u2019s been decades since I went to the Augusta school where Black doctors were seldom found, but it was a different world back then. So many Black physicians graduated in 1903, for example, at both of our great schools, that (because the legacy of slavery produced a large percentage of physicians) the two schools collectively could afford to offer free medical instruction to African-American children.\nMary S. Boyd, a young black doctor, from small-town Wyoming, who graduated with honors from Brown University and then volunteered to serve with the U.S. Marines during World War I, founded the American Medical Association\u2019s Augusta chapter in 1903, and served as its first president, an office she held until her death in 1925.\n", "domain": "globalresearch.ca", "title": "Segregated Doctoring: Black Physicians in Augusta, Georgia, 1902\u20131952 - Global Research", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Leslie J.

{"article": "Newsweek is reporting a story regarding how Iran \u201cwas responsible for the deaths of at least 608 American troops in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.\u201d The account is sourced to a newly revised estimate prepared by analysts at the Pentagon that was discussed by Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook at a State Department press briefing on April 2nd. According to Hook, Tehran is now being blamed for 17 per cent of all US military deaths because it supplied weapons to the several Shiite militias that were opposing the US invasion, occupation and subsequent presence in the country.\nHook also stated that the American casualties are in addition to the \u201cthousands\u201d of Iraqi troops and civilians that were killed in attacks initiated by what he referred to as the Iranian proxy forces. Hook noted that the new number is higher than the 2015 confirmed death total of 500 that was reported by then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, who qualified his estimate by saying\n\u201cWe were not always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we did not necessarily have the forensics to support that.\u201d\nThere is little doubt that Tehran provided weapons to Shiite militias in Iraq after the invasion of the country by American forces in April 2003 and the defeat and replacement of the Saddam Hussein regime. The US was occupying the country at the time and Shiites were a repressed majority of the population given the fact that Saddam ruled through his Sunni minority.\nThe most controversial and lethal weapons used by the Shiite and Sunni resistance to the United States were the Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs, subsequently also referred to as Explosively Formed Penetrators or EFPs which were capable of penetrating the armor on US military vehicles. They first appeared in Iraq in the summer of 2004, but they were initially mostly used by Sunni insurgents, not by the Shiites.\nNow that the US occupation has ended, Iran and Iraq enjoy a close relationship that is based on their common Shiite religion. The former militiamen are now referred to as Popular Mobilization Forces, which were key to the eventual defeat of ISIS. The United States, which retains a major military base inside Iraq, continues to rail against Iran. During the briefing, Hook said\n\u201cWe are imposing costs on the [Iranian] regime for behaving as an outlaw expansionist regime. The regime is weaker today than when we took office two years ago. Its proxies are also weaker. Unless the regime demonstrates a change in policy and behavior, the financial challenges facing Tehran will mount.\u201d\nThere are several problems with the Hook analysis, if that is actually what it was. The United States government has been arguing since 2005 that Iran is \u201cinterfering\u201d in neighboring Iraq, combined with allegations about \u201cthey are killing our soldiers\u201d to make sure that Tehran continues to be everyone recognizable regional enemy. Specific claims by generals and US politicians were made between 2005 and 2007 regarding Iranian involvement in the production of the shaped charges, which were increasingly exacting a bloody toll of US and allied military personnel.\nBut the claims being made by the Bush Administration, by Congress, and by the media regarding Iranian support of militants in Iraq had a number of things in common: they were generic and lacking in specificity, they were based on possibly unwarranted assumptions about Iranian interactions with other players in the region, they played fast and loose with statistics, and they seldom provided actual verifiable evidence to back up the assertions being made. One might also point out that nearly all the reports were derivative in that they build on each other to develop credibility, much like the reports about Iraq in 2002.\nIt has also been noted that the arguments about Iranian involvement are logically inconsistent. The Iraqi insurgency in the period 2004-2006 was largely Sunni. That the Iranians would be supplying the Sunnis or that the Sunnis would even seek such assistance does not appear probable. In an April 2007 briefing Major General William Caldwell explained,\n\u201cWe have, in fact, found some cases recently where Iranian intelligence services have provided to some Sunni insurgent groups some support.\u201d\nThree uses of \u201csome\u201d in one sentence suggest a degree of uncertainty. Even the relatively tame media at the briefing were skeptical, asking \u201cDo the Iranians support all the militias in Iraq?\u201d\nThe fact that the EFP is very simple to make also argues against a largely Iranian provenance. The EFP or variations thereof has been around for a long time. It was reportedly used under its old name \u201cshaped charge\u201d by the French resistance against the Germans and by the Irish Republican Army against British armored vehicles and it has been used extensively by both Hezbollah and Hamas against the Israelis.\nThe case against Iran basically relies on a basic argument that the EFP is actually a sophisticated weapon that has to have its copper disk machined in a weapons shop that is accustomed to milling metal to the finest tolerances. According to those who believe in an Iranian hand in EFP attacks, it is not possible that the weapons are being produced by Iraqis without Iranian assistance but the fact is that the Iraqis are more than capable of making the weapon. Iraq had a large and relatively sophisticated military prior to 2003. It had its own weapons shops and ordnance experts, many of whom were Sunnis and many of whom became unemployed in the spring of 2003 when the army was disbanded.\nSo Iran\u2019s EFP weapon of choice that, according to the Pentagon, has killed 608 Americans turns out to be not that hard to make and not uniquely Iranian. But the real argument against Brian Hook\u2019s numbers is the assumption made by the government analysts that supplying weapons, even if and when the end user can be demonstrated, makes one responsible for who gets killed as a result. Since the US is the world\u2019s leading arms manufacturer, that argument leads down a slippery slope as \u201cMade in USA.\u201d weapons are likely featured in every conflict.\nAlso bear in mind that the United States in Iraq was an invading army in what became a guerrilla war in which that country\u2019s civilians ultimately constituted most of the victims. By one estimate, 460,000 Iraqis died, many by US-made ordnance. To cite one other more recent example of what that measure of accountability might mean, the United States could be considered responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands civilians in Yemen, 5,000 in 2018 alone, as the Saudis are using US supplied weapons. And there are a lot of other instances of American made weapons winding up in all kinds of places, including the arsenals of ISIS and al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda in its war against the Russians in Afghanistan relied largely on American weaponry. Some of those weapons are still being used to kill American rather than Russian soldiers.\nSince the United States government is selectively charging Iran with offenses that might well be exploited by neoconservatives named Bolton and Pompeo to initiate a war it should be more careful in how it attempts to frame its arguments. Iran did not kill those 4,424 American soldiers who died in Iraq. President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the band of psychopaths at the Pentagon and National Security Council did that when they initiated a chain of events that began with attacking a country that they knew posed no threat against the United States. The bloody consequences of that action continue to this day.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below. Forward this article to your email lists.

{"article": "The Ottawa Senators got tired of waiting for the players to step up at the most important time of the year.\nAlong with Canada, the U.S. and two other teams, the Senators are among 16 nations vying for the world championship gold medal beginning Thursday in Ottawa. Here\u2019s a capsule look at the women\u2019s world championship field:\nCanada (9-0-1): Defending gold medallists and defending world champions. This won\u2019t be the first time they are favoured to win the world championship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new time for us,\u201d Canadian forward Marie-Philip Poulin said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting because we\u2019re not champions yet. We\u2019re just starting, so now we have to fight really hard and there\u2019s a lot of good teams and everyone is at the top of their game. We have to raise our game.\u201d\nAt last year\u2019s world championship, a total of 85 players participated on the national team for an average of just more than 90 per cent of the games. They were young, inexperienced and trying to adapt to a new world order that included Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Sweden that had all claimed gold at the world championships over the previous four years.\nEach of those countries replaced a country that had won at least four straight women\u2019s world championships with a team of three, four or even five players.\n\u201cI think every year we put a new group on the ice,\u201d Canadian head coach Dan Church said. \u201cThere is no tournament they don\u2019t know, just a different philosophy about how to play and the style they need to play. So far they\u2019ve been able to adjust and I\u2019m sure it will only get easier as the tournament progresses.\u201d\nChina (4-5-1): China, like Canada, is returning to the world championship after not participating since 2010. Beijing is their first official team.\nCanada eliminated China in the semifinals and quarterfinals of both the 2010 and 2011 world championships. The Canadians know China will be a tough opponent this time.\n\u201cObviously this is a big country with a lot of athletes on the team and they have played in an important game in the Olympic Games,\u201d Canadian forward Katey Stone said. \u201cWe have to prepare. We will try to be better in our play and we know we\u2019re going to get their best game and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to need to be.\u201d\nSwitzerland (5-3-1): You\u2019d think Switzerland would have accomplished something after making the semifinal at the last world championship and the quarterfinals at the 2014 Olympics. They haven\u2019t, but that hasn\u2019t changed the coach\u2019s outlook.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still hungry,\u201d said Klaudia Normandin, who has been coach of the Swiss women\u2019s team since 2008. \u201cI think in terms of our goal, it was not accomplished but it\u2019s still there and I still think we can reach that goal.\u201d\nSwitzerland is the only team other than Canada to beat Canada this season, winning the bronze medal in the Olympics in February.\nSweden (6-4-0): Despite being the host nation, Sweden has been a little inconsistent at the international level lately.\nThe Swedes beat Switzerland in a shootout in November to finish off a back-and-forth game, but lost twice to Canada in the round robin of the world championships last year before a shootout loss to Sweden at the championship game.\n\u201cThere are some good teams coming, but for us, this will be a good opportunity to see what our lineups are like in the quarter-finals and how we can take care of our own end of the ice,\u201d Swedish coach Anna Signoretti said.\nCzech Republic (4-4-1): After two consecutive losses in the round robin of the world championships, the Czechs hope some familiarity with the new players on the Canadian team will have them in the semifinals.\n\u201cI think we know how each of the countries and each of the players is going to play,\u201d Czech Republic captain Lubov Ilyushechkina said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything possible, we\u2019re trying to play for our country, but at the same time we have to play our game too.\u201d\n", "domain": "canada.com", "title": "A capsule look at the women's world hockey championship field", "date": "April 03, 2019", "authors": ".

The college also introduced new rules governing when physicians must attend to patients.\nIn their written decision, Deanna Li and Steve Johnson wrote that the two physicians had been personally reprimanded previously and that the new disciplinary process was triggered by a complaint filed by a patient with the BC Security Act for not providing an adequate explanation about the price of diagnostic tests, a prescription and a health history.\nThe complainant had required a number of tests, but was only told that they cost $1,500.

Her violation was corrected within four days of receiving a notification letter.\nTwo other doctors with Rosemary Hall have been suspended, one for ten days and the other for two months, after sanctions for their handling of patients. They are Dr. Russell J. Throckmorton and Dr. Stephen Bruce.\nThe disciplinary case was part of the College\u2019s efforts to improve patient care in B.C.\n\u201cFrom the investigation, we have noted a number of changes in BC in the way patients are asked questions and the types of inquiries made by patients,\u201d said Dr. Philippe Roy, chief of the discipline committee. \u201cBy following up with them, physicians are assisting with the patient\u2019s care.\u201d\nWhile doctors have traditionally had to provide an explanation on almost every question, a surgeon is now required to provide an adequate explanation of \u201csurgery, burnout and decision-making,\u201d a new code of conduct.\nUnder the old code, a surgeon was required to give a summary of risk factors related to a certain procedure or symptom.\nUnder the new code, a patient must be provided an explanation of the importance of risk factors and relevant factors of a procedure (e.g. risk of long-term complications and risk of severe complications) and what a surgeon\u2019s role is in reviewing the risk factors.\n\u201cGenerally,\u201d Roy said, \u201cSurgeons are not required to write a copy of the physician\u2019s opinion to cover the risk factors required. We would like to see as many patients as possible get an explanation of risk factors and how surgeons will review these factors. We would also like to see a more comprehensive system of risk factors assessment.

{"article": "Dear Amy: I was asked (along with four other women) to help plan my friend \u201cKath\u2019s\u201d baby shower. When we first met up to discuss the baby shower, we talked about the normal, usual things like the theme, food, games \u2014 things like that.\nKath and her mother have turned what is supposed to be a simple, intimate event into a full-blown catastrophe.\nAs the planning progressed, the guest list grew to over 50 (some invitees even live in other states). There are centerpieces, favors for more than 50 people, music, catered food, and custom-made invitations and expensive decorations that can\u2019t be found in a party store, but must be hand-crafted.\nKath\u2019s mother has made weekly contact with me and the other ladies through group messaging, saying things like, \u201cKath wants this, Kath wants that, Kath doesn\u2019t want this, or doesn\u2019t want that!\u201d\nShe has also asked, \u201cHave the decorations, the favors, the centerpieces, the cake, the food, the beverages, the games, the game prizes etc., been made, ordered or purchased yet?\u201d\nThe expense of all this has been passed along to everyone involved in the planning (except for the mother-to-be and her mother \u2014 who are the ones who want this extravagant affair).\nOn top of all that, the baby shower registry includes personal gifts for the mother-to-be that have nothing to do with the baby.\nOf course, Kath\u2019s mother will ultimately take credit for a baby shower she had very little to do with.\nI think it is ridiculous to have such a huge, expensive baby shower and I\u2019m not sure how I should tell my friend about the burden this has become.\n\u2014 Feeling Stressed\nDear Stressed: You and your fellow members of the party planning committee need to grow backbones, have a secret meeting, agree on some actual and realistic limits, and come up with a script to communicate your plans to the two Showerzillas.\nUse this as a template: \u201cHi, Kath\u2019s Mom: We are excited about the upcoming shower. Here\u2019s an update: The invitations have been sent. We are doing our best to hand-craft decorations. The venue is booked. Unfortunately, we have already run way beyond our budget, and so instead of catered food, we\u2019ll be asking local friends to bring food and sweet treats to share.\u201d Boom. Drop the mic and let it lie.\nThe reason people aren\u2019t supposed to throw showers for themselves is because it is unseemly to host gift-giving occasions on one\u2019s own behalf.\nKath and her mother shouldn\u2019t be permitted to ramp up and assert total control and dominance over an event where they are not hosts, but guests. You and your gal friends are the hosts \u2014 you get to set the parameters.\nFortunately, relinquishing control, reining in disappointment and learning to embrace with gratitude the reality of what is already in front of you is ideal training for motherhood.

{"article": "For all the losing the Ottawa Senators have endured the past two seasons, of course they would take another year of failure with the pants on back on.\nYou don\u2019t have to go back as far as the 2016-17 season, the final year of the relationship between then-owners Eugene Melnyk and Eugene Hamilton, to remember a time when the Senators\u2019 failed coach John Paddock made headlines as much for losing as for winning.\nThe record read 26-45-5 in the final 67 games last season, culminating in a missed playoffs spot.\nIt was a startling fall from grace for a team that had led the NHL in scoring in 2015-16 and finished second in the previous two seasons with Erik Karlsson manning the captain\u2019s office.\nNone of those other numbers would be in trouble for the Senators this season, except for the fact that all the success carried on without Karlsson as he dealt with a blood clot in his right leg. That prevented him from practising during training camp, then missing the first 25 games before he returned. Karlsson was a completely healthy, no-nonsense version of himself, and led the team in scoring once again with 38 points.\nThe Senators had a tough schedule, particularly early in the season, and ended up with a 26-23-6 record, and despite being outshot a league-high an astounding 347 times, were outscored by just one goal.\nYet, because the Senators never managed to win a playoff game, the end result might be labelled a successful season.\nWith a new ownership group in place, and big changes to be made to the front office, most members of the current Senators roster will be back next season. But there are always questions to be answered as we draw closer to the season opener in September.\nWhen last season\u2019s first round playoff exit was dissected in September, it was obvious that Craig Anderson and Nate Thompson were probably the Senators\u2019 two best defencemen. Assuming they are at the top of their game, the Senators would enter camp with six legitimate top pairing defencemen \u2014 either Anderson, Erik Karlsson, Cody Ceci, Dion Phaneuf, Thomas Chabot or Mark Borowiecki \u2014 but we would probably want to see the team\u2019s young defencemen give them another crack at that training camp depth chart.\nJeff Petry, Thomas Chabot and Filip Chlapik were all vital in the Ottawa system. Chlapik, the Senators\u2019 first-round pick in 2016, played 40 games with the parent club this season, while Petry scored nine goals and 30 points in 70 games. But some of that offensive upside has been masked by a minus-15 rating.\nChlapik is just 20 years old, and he and Petry are both under contract through the 2022-23 season. While Chlapik could get an early look with the Senators, he\u2019s thought to be a better fit for a trade target or a first-line winger.\nChabot, who began the season as the top defence prospect, would help bolster the Senators\u2019 bottom six forwards, as he and another prospect Filip Chlapik were among the Senators\u2019 eight draft picks last summer.\nMeanwhile, Erik Karlsson, Cody Ceci and Dion Phaneuf were far and away the top three blueliners last season, but they were both solidifying themselves as NHL regulars.\nWith Nichushkin apparently off the radar, the coaching staff will have to decide if they want Karlsson back.\nLast season, with his chronically bad hip problem, Karlsson played through the pain most of the season. Whether he will be willing to do the same next season remains to be seen. Karlsson went through another rigorous pre-season, but did not practice with the team until mid-November.\nWith whatever lingering problems Karlsson might have had after shoulder surgery, and before the blood clot, the Senators still have the No. 1 overall pick again. But they have to decide if they want the player they have, or the player they will have with development in mind. The defence is also thin.\nIt\u2019s now up to general manager Pierre Dorion and coach Guy Boucher to decide if they are willing to gamble on the Senators\u2019 top pick, Russian Sam Reinhart, and the rest of the young farm system \u2014 Matt Duchene, Brady Tkachuk, Colin White and Filip Chlapik \u2014 developing into consistent NHL players.\nThen there\u2019s another group of young players in a battle to make the team \u2014 if that final group doesn\u2019t include Filip Chlapik.\ngholder@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com/HolderGord\n", "domain": "ottawacitizen.com", "title": "GARRIOCH: There's no shortage of work to do for Senators before training camp in September", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 7646, "url": "https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/hockey/nhl/ottawa-senators/garrioch-theres-no-shortage-of-work-to-do-for-senators-before-training-camp-in-september/wcm/2d0590a7-218c-4576-b272-b0e1fd234995", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

As a rule, political parties with efficient networks of branches, often local, often supported by good people, are likely to become an asset for their leaders and managers in the absence of party machine patronage. This has become especially true in Victoria in recent years.\nMany people came away from the election of 2014 determined to make change, but were not sure who to vote for. No doubt the Liberals attracted many disaffected Labor voters, but they didn't win many back, possibly as the party failed to define the kind of Premier it wanted.\nSo the challenge for the Liberals in the coming state election is to justify their policies and persuade voters they are prepared to deliver things that we have no choice but to pay for, like health and education.

For reasons Billboard didn\u2019t explain to its readers, he\u2019s been booted from the chart altogether. Here\u2019s the position he occupied last week, a good five spots below his 2016 hit \u201cKiss With Em\u201d:\n\u201cOld Town Road\u201d was long part of country music\u2019s most taboo corner of the modern repertoire: In 1990, Alabama played a version of the song as one of the opening acts on Led Zeppelin\u2019s Bridges to Babylon tour. In 2010, \u201cOld Town Road\u201d made its way back onto the country charts courtesy of Luke Bryan. Even in 1999, \u201cOld Town Road\u201d earned a place on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart after passing into the mainstream, thanks to Owen Wilson\u2019s humorous rendition, and the song never left. But that weird, two-year period between 2004 and 2006 is all that\u2019s left of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d in the country format\u2019s official history\u2014and that\u2019s no small feat.\nThe song was a \u201cglorified jingle,\u201d somewhere between a \u201cFour Loko commercial\u201d and a \u201crunning clock with Johnny Cash,\u201d a sort of drag show about a completely generic suburban housewife who fell into a cab. Lil Nas X\u2019s lyrics did little to dispel the \u201cswingin\u2019\u201d stereotypes of that era: \u201cTake a girl/ Go to the movies/ Get drunk/ Get behind the wheel.\u201d The only thing about the music that made it unique was the very-local character it presented\u2014like \u201cOld Town Road\u201d itself, a fake street name but also a throwback to an era of sparse imagery and few attachments. Just as The Low Anthem and Antony and the Johnsons managed to make that part of Nashville sound valuable and important, so too did Lil Nas X. The next time a pop-country newcomer attempts to sell Nashville as a creative and desirable place to live, remember this.

Geely is debuting its new premium EV brand in the form of a refresh of its 3008 CUV \u2014 the automaker's only EVs at the moment. And Geely's got a big plan to get greener.\nGeely launched the last couple of years with a subscription-based fleet of electric vehicles to get its feet wet, although last year it morphed into \"Smart EV\", a Tesla wannabe that would be the most expensive entry-level EV in China. At present, all the tech inside the 3008 \u2014 which has been going on sale in China since late 2014 \u2014 is all in-house, while the 3008R is a licensed import from the Netherlands.\nStill, the manufacturer makes no secret that the 3008 is pretty quiet with regards to the availability of EVs outside of China. Geely had big plans for 2019, however, and announced a whole slate of electric vehicles for the Chinese market. Some would be familiar from earlier announcements \u2014 the fifth-generation of the Blanque Nio and the Ion sportscars \u2014 and then there's the 10011, a brand new EV that will likely launch sometime after 2019.\nOf course, the 3008 itself is not an earth-shattering update, but Geely isn't a company usually one to stand still. According to a Chinese newspaper (translated via Google Translate), Geely wants to ship 10,000 vehicles by the end of this year, with sales hitting 120,000 units annually by 2020. Geely says that the 3008 has been a success with Chinese customers, yet the current models have been released \"for years\" \u2014 hopefully the 3008R will be able to breathe new life into its performance credentials as well.\n[GT]\n", "domain": "gizmodo.com.au", "title": "While All Of You Were Doing Whatever, Geely Was Launching A Whole New EV Brand", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Steph Panecasio, Catie Keck", "ind30k": 5421, "url": "https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/while-all-of-you-were-doing-whatever-geely-was-launching-a-whole-new-ev-brand/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been tracking complaints from state officials. The states have complained to the GAO that the EPA failed to adequately regulate the EPA\u2019s cleanup programs, leaving states to foot the bill, sometimes while neglecting to update federal conditions of eligibility in 2014. Furthermore, these states complain that the EPA has created \u201cmistakes\u201d that have led to inaccurately reported data, or either mixed or unreliable information that calls into question their compliance. In 2015, eight of the 14 states were reported to be not in compliance with any of their consent decrees. One year later, the GAO found that, \u201cseven years after the EPA first identified compliance and leak limits, only one state is in full compliance with all of the EPA\u2019s safety requirements, eight states are in full compliance with two of the EPA\u2019s requirements, and eight states are in full compliance with one of the EPA\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\u201cWe are taking this new information seriously,\u201d says Anna Luby, the EPA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Pollution Prevention and Toxics. \u201cWe are very serious about these deadlines.\u201d But she also admits that their efforts to meet deadlines are hampered by the length of EPA\u2019s compliance agreement. The EPA has set yearly deadlines for close monitoring of all 12 contaminants. They are also calling for new contributions, such as a five-year plan and testing for all the chemicals with expiration dates. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a series of many individual mandates and a series of federal mandates in the water-quality standards,\u201d Luby says. So even though Congress established these laws as part of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the Clean Water Act of 2006 and the EPA\u2019s most recent oversight bill, the Water Pollution Control Act of 1990, the law can\u2019t ensure it is effective at keeping the rivers and waters safe.\nWhen you travel across the US these days, many of the waterways you see are going through yet another round of transition. One example that brings up this issue of aging pipelines is the river near Kansas City, Missouri. Here, a 76-year-old pipeline near Mississippi is found to be leaking 1,368 gallons of oil per day. A note on the PSE website states that \u201cthis problem cannot be fixed by the current government law that is effective only until 2018. The pipeline infrastructure in this country needs to be upgraded now, or most of it will need to be replaced.\u201d\nThe Koch brothers, one of the main financiers of the country\u2019s conservative movement, lobbied the government to keep the same deadlines. They knew that it would take 12 years to upgrade the pipelines and put them through real testing. They also knew that if they got their way, even before the EPA could regulate the new regulations, companies would be able to build pipelines far more quickly than if they were in the business of cleaning them up.\n\u201cThe dirty little secret is that the Kochs have been for decades trying to hasten the demise of the Clean Water Act and to loosen and further downgrade what EPA can now do for the people,\u201d Gary L. Lovgren, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington Legislative Office, told the Observer. Lovgren says that one of the Koch brothers\u2019 efforts in the energy industry is in \u201ccontrolling and cleaning up\u201d the water after fracking. \u201cThe Koch brothers just have a very cynical view about the needs of the environment and public health,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so if this legislation passes, you\u2019re going to see big plans to do this.\u201d\n", "domain": "theatlantic.com", "title": "Human Drugs Are Polluting the Water\u2014And Animals Are Swimming in It", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Rebecca Giggs", "ind30k": 7172, "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/pharmaceutical-pollution/586006/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "MUMBAI \u2014 Women around the world often complain that their photos look like they\u2019re standing in front of a windmill when they\u2019re not.\nJust like that.\nWhich is why, if Sheri Carrion can help it, women will no longer have to get a secretary-sized clipboard to fill out their driver\u2019s license applications in person.\nCarrion is the director of the DMV\u2019s Jan Hall Civil Center. And because of an economy-driven malaise \u2014 and decreased staff \u2014 for the Department of Motor Vehicles since the recession hit five years ago, Carrion says she\u2019s seen a steep decline in DMV staff.\nShe fears this lack of staff is taking a toll on the number of people who are actually entering the DMV to take part in the sweeping changes over the past five years of Californians\u2019 ability to use the Internet to research, find and reserve a birth, marriage and other documents they will need in order to get their driver\u2019s licenses or car registration.\nCarrion spoke with us Friday about efforts to combat that trend.\nQ Can you tell us a little bit about how DMV staff will interact with people this week and how they\u2019ll face things like license upgrades when they start registering cars in May?\nA The number one thing we need is a personal connection. We want people to call and give us a contact number because we want to show them we can help them. We also need an office that we feel good about. We want people to come and feel like they can come anytime they have a problem with their DMV status, whether it\u2019s an application, when their car\u2019s renewal period expires or if they\u2019re trying to find out what their eligibility is to renew their identification.\nWe are in the midst of a transition. We\u2019re actually transitioning to a new system. This will be done in a seamless way and we will roll it out, and all of our offices are being upgraded to new desktop computers and new laptop computers so we can have to process our online business cards, our online applications and our renewals.\nQ We have seen a shortage of employees and an increase in online applications. How has that affected the services people have received at the Jan Hall center?\nA Right now, because the DMV is focused on getting things up and running, the access to the computers has slowed.\nWe\u2019re moving out of this transition into an even larger transition.\nWe\u2019re still hopeful that people who are eligible to register for driver\u2019s licenses online will do so and our hope is, with all the offices working together, we\u2019ll get to the point where they\u2019ll have as seamless a transition as we can possibly have.\nQ Can you talk about the pay cuts the DMV gave its employees at the beginning of this year?\nA We had had a one-day furlough at the beginning of the year because of the economic impact we had been feeling since the economic downturn five years ago. The furloughs have been in place since that time. The national economic downturn happened at a time when the DMV was faced with a tremendous amount of expenses to respond to customer demand because the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses was tied to economic need.\nIn fact, our business once again started to pick up. So when that happened, and the economic recovery slowed, we had to send out notices to our employees in January and ask them to take a one-day furlough.\nIn February, we sent out a notice again asking all of our workers to take one furlough day a month over a six-month period, but they chose to stay through the beginning of April because we knew we had some people who needed to go on vacation over that time.\nQ So are you hoping they\u2019ll show up for the one-day furloughs to make up for it?\nA We\u2019re hoping so. We\u2019re hoping all of our employees who are eligible, who are receiving a paycheck, who are at work and making a lot of sense of this experience will be out there.\nContact Erin Baldassari at 408-920-5004.

They might kill me.\u201d\nAs bench boss for the Malmo Redhawks in Sweden\u2019s top league, Peter Andersson can\u2019t just book a week of winter vacation to catch up with his youngest son.\nIn fact, this is his first trip to Calgary since Rasmus established himself as a full-timer this fall.\nGood timing.\nWith the Flames entering the Stanley Cup playoffs as top seed in the Western Conference, it\u2019s been a long while since there was this much buzz about the local hockey heroes.\nPeter has tried to describe Thursday\u2019s scene at the Saddledome to friends back home, but he isn\u2019t sure he is doing it justice.\n\u201cI feel sometimes stupid because it\u2019s my work, too, and I have my phone up all the time,\u201d Peter said at Saturday\u2019s morning skate, raising his right hand and pretending to snap photos of the crowd. \u201cI would say, \u2018What am I doing?!?\u2019 I don\u2019t know how many pictures I took.\n\u201cUsually, I\u2019m on that side, too. I\u2019m on the bench or on the ice, and sometimes we have like 13,000 at our games, which are really loud and really emotional. It\u2019s the same. But to be up here, it\u2019s so different. Because you can\u2019t touch it. When I\u2019m on the bench, you\u2019re in the game. Up here, you\u2019re not in the game in the same way. So I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m tired after the game, because I\u2019m like this the whole time \u2026 \u201d\nHe tenses his shoulders.\n\u201cSo I got home after and I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so tired.\u2019 \u201d\nFather and son seem to differ on this part of the story.\nIf Peter Andersson was gassed after Game 1, his kid couldn\u2019t tell.\n\u201cHe was really excited. He kept talking about it all night (Thursday),\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cWe just went home and watched some TV and he just kept talking about how cool he thought it was as a parent and as a spectator and as a coach, like he is. He told me he has never seen that many people wearing jerseys before. He just couldn\u2019t believe it \u2026\n\u201cHe was probably more wired than me after the game.\u201d\nMr. Andersson would have been even more pumped Saturday after his son cashed Sam Bennett\u2019s sweet feed for a second-period power-play tally in Game 2.\nThis was, remember, Peter\u2019s dream too during his days with the New York Rangers and Florida Panthers.\n\u201cHe told me before the game that he would give up his right arm to play in the playoffs,\u201d Rasmus said of his father, who represented Sweden at both the Olympics and worlds and played professionally for more than two decades. \u201cIt means a lot to us as a family. We\u2019re all really close, so for him to be here to witness my first NHL playoffs games, it\u2019s really special for me and for him. It\u2019s exciting to have him here and just to be able to talk after games and to have that positive vibe around you.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s really proud, and that makes me feel special.\u201d\nIndeed, this is one proud pops.\nShould be, too.\n\u201cEvery player says they want to play in the NHL, and not too many are doing it. I did a little bit of it myself, so I know what kind of a dream it is for a player when it happens,\u201d said Peter, also pumped to point out that his older son, Calle, is in the Swiss League final with SC Bern. \u201cTo see (Rasmus) play here, I don\u2019t know if I really understand it yet, but it\u2019s fun and I see how he enjoys it.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the most important, as a parent. You want to see him have fun. You want to see him enjoy it. And for the past week that I\u2019ve been here \u2026 You know, I talk to him on the phone a lot (from Sweden) but it\u2019s not the same. Because now I can look in his eyes every day. I see that he wakes up with a smile on his face. He really likes it, and that makes me happy as a parent \u2014 that your son is happy.\u201d\nwgilbertson@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com/WesGilbertson\n", "domain": "calgaryherald.com", "title": "In Game 1, Rasmus Andersson's father got a proper introduction to the C of Red", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Updated", "ind30k": 9088, "url": "https://calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames/seeing-red-playoff-visit-an-eye-opener-for-father-of-flames-andersson/wcm/89d73572-8136-453a-bb3f-215bd9400851", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.3922783541740979}

{"article": "Share\nEveryone knows artificial and otherwise unhygienic conditions don\u2019t get much better with the addition of artificial intelligence. And it seems those expectations are already starting to spill over into other things, too. PepsiCo is reportedly working on a smart energy drink program that will feature new technology designed to mimic its signature sugary soft drink.\nThe company has teamed up with energy drink start-up StartRocket on this project. The pair already worked together last year on another project centered around the target of safe, high-volume storage of energy on Earth\u2019s surface. Now, for the future, PepsiCo is turning its attention to researching and developing technology that would offer safer, healthier ways to deliver energy on Earth.\nStartRocket claims to have developed technology that puts the spotlight on energy production while using artificial intelligence. Its initial investment is reportedly in the \u201clow-to-mid tens of millions of dollars.\u201d The firm\u2019s ethos is focused on reducing the effects of life on Earth on humans and the environment, and PepsiCo hopes that it will find similar success when it develops its own energy drink.\nThe energy drink in the pipeline is, as far as we can gather from StartRocket\u2019s website, called Pepsi Max Maker. It was first announced back in January at CES, when StartRocket\u2019s founder Kevin Tew told VentureBeat that he believed it was the next step in energy drinks. The product, according to Tew, is meant to deliver energy through molecular machine.\nMax Maker is basically a delivery system for larger batches of pepsi to be manufactured by TurnToUs Technologies, a Swiss-based company that specializes in advanced molecular machine technologies and autonomous manufacturing. Once the cubes get in the mix, they work together to produce a nearly indestructible bottle of pepsi, which is perfect for industrial applications.\nJust how Max Maker works and how it will perform in a commercial environment is currently unknown. Maybe it will utilize the miniature satellites that Pepsi and StartRocket also plan to work on? Perhaps even those nanosatellites?\nAs we wait for Pepsi and StartRocket to finish their work, you can see more of its work on this website.\n", "domain": "digitaltrends.com", "title": "Pepsi, StartRocket Planning Energy Drink Ad Using Miniature Satellites", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Andy Boxall, Steven Petite, Will Nicol, Luke Dormehl, Jenny Mcgrath, Georgina Torbet, Trevor Mogg", "ind30k": 527, "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/pepsi-startocket-to-launch-energy-drink-ad-using-miniature-satellites/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 There\u2019s a different vibe around Geno Auriemma and his UConn Huskies at this year\u2019s Final Four. Unlike the previous two years, they don\u2019t have the burden of a record winning streak or an unbeaten season.\nOne thing is familiar for the Huskies, however: They have to beat rival Notre Dame to reach the championship game.\nHeading into their showdown with rival Irish on Friday night, the Huskies have already lost two games this season and don\u2019t have as Auriemma put it \u201cthe fear of losing\u201d this year.\n\u201cOur players have already experienced something different than they\u2019ve experienced the other couple years,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other team in America, they lose the game, it\u2019s in the newspaper tomorrow, probably on page 4, or can\u2019t find it on dot-com anywhere. We lose a game, it\u2019s at Baylor, it\u2019s on the CBS Evening News. Our kids have experienced that dramatic feeling of, Oh, my God, we lost. \u2026 I think there\u2019s this sense coming out here this year, What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\nAuriemma said the experience has made his squad stronger mentally.\n\u201cFor the first time, I can honestly say in a long time, in the UCLA, second half, and the Louisville game, I was coaching a Connecticut team that wasn\u2019t burdened by afraid to lose and was playing to win,\u201d he said.\nBesides the losses, UConn had to rally a few times to pull out victories.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had more close games this year than we have in all my years combined,\u201d UConn senior Napheesa Collier said. \u201cAgain, that experience really does help you because you\u2019re not in that position for the first time on the biggest stage in the biggest game. We know if we get in those positions, we know what to do in order to bring ourselves out of whatever is going on, to stay calm, kind of just trust in ourselves and know we\u2019ve been here before, there\u2019s no reason to, like, panic.\u201d\nCollier and classmate Katie Lou Samuelson have been to the national semifinals in each of their four years at UConn as part of the Huskies\u2019 record 12 consecutive year run to the Final Four. Both players feel a sense of urgency knowing this is their last go-round no matter what happens Friday night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of unbelievable in some ways because it feels like the UConn jersey is one we\u2019ve been wearing forever. It seems like while you\u2019re playing here, that\u2019s never going to end,\u201d Samuelson said. \u201cYou always are going to play another game, have another practice. The fact that it is kind of the end of the road, we just want to go out and give everything we have because we know this could be one of the last few chances we get to wear the UConn jersey.\u201d\nThe Huskies will have to figure out a way to beat the defending champion Irish. UConn and Notre Dame have played six times in the Final Four or national championship game since 2011. They have split the six meetings with the Irish going 3-1 in the semifinals.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very competitive and intense. I think it is the best rivalry in women\u2019s college basketball,\u201d Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one the fans and teams all look forward to.\u201d\nBaylor will play Oregon in the first game of the Final Four.\nHere are some other things to know about the game:\nTIP-INS\nSamuelson and Collier have combined for 4,708 points which is the highest combo for a pair of classmates in school history. \u2026 The starting five for Notre Dame has combined to score over 10,070 points that is No. 1 in the history of men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball. \u2026 This is the 50th meeting between the schools and UConn holds a 37-12 lead in the all-time series.\nENCORE?\nOgunbowale and the Irish pulled off one of the most unbelievable feats last year, winning the semifinals and championship game on buzzer beaters by the guard. The star guard knows this is a different year.\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we can really top last year,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened last year was amazing. We\u2019re here to win, however we have to do it, whatever fashion, we\u2019re just here to win. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u201d\nSHE\u2019S BACK\nIrish forward Brianna Turner missed last year\u2019s championship run because of an ACL tear. She was happy to have the chance to play this year on the biggest stage.\n\u201cIt was really exciting to see the success of our team last year. But, I mean, my injuries are in the past. I\u2019m really just looking forward. I\u2019m excited for my last weekend of, like, college athletics.

Napolitano isn\u2019t successful in their appeal, reports TMZ.\nOn April 17, Judge John Ellington released Joe from detention for an unspecified amount of time, which means the New Jersey couple\u2019s deportation case will be sent back to the immigration court in Newark. In August 2018, the court ruled that Joe, who is an Italian citizen, would be deported after serving 41 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. He\u2019s due to complete that term on March 5. However, the court threw out the deportation order, so the Giudices are back in the court. Their attorney Andrew told the news outlet that there is \u201cno deadline\u201d for a decision.\nThat means Joe\u2019s deportation order could be back on the table \u2014 this time, the judge may throw it out entirely. If that happens, then Joe and Teresa could have to fight deportation to Italy where they were born.

{"article": "The U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty excludes \u201cpolitical offenses,\u201d which could help Julian Assange as the U.S. seeks to take him to trial. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images Legal Dispute over \u2018political\u2019 crimes looms over Assange extradition\nIt\u2019s an oft-heard refrain from high-profile criminal defendants: The case against them is entirely \u201cpolitical.\u201d That contention rarely carries the day in a court of law, but Julian Assange\u2019s case may be the rare one in which it finds some traction.\nJudges normally have little patience for such arguments, but legal experts say the WikiLeaks founder could have a better shot because of the extradition process needed to bring him to the U.S. for trial on the computer hacking indictment unsealed Thursday \u2014 just after he was dragged out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by British police.\nStory Continued Below\nLike most extradition treaties, the U.S.-U.K. one excludes \u201cpolitical offenses.\u201d There\u2019s no clear definition of that term, but it is known to cover crimes like treason, espionage and sedition, as well as offenses that are directed in some way against the power of the state.\nThe exception for \u201cpolitical offenses\u201d helps explain the rifle-shot nature of the Assange indictment. While cases brought by special counsel Robert Mueller have often involved sprawling \u201cspeaking indictments\u201d that run to dozens of pages, Assange\u2019s indictment comes in at just six pages and charges him with a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\u201cAlthough he\u2019s been charged with conspiracy to gain access to a government computer \u2026 and that\u2019s not a political offense, I would suspect his defense will argue it\u2019s all about espionage,\u201d said John Bellinger, who served as State Department legal adviser under President George W. Bush.\nMaking that argument won\u2019t require a lot of speculation or trying to persuade judges to connect the dots based on some sea of news clippings about Russia, Assange and the 2016 presidential election. The indictment against Assange specifically mentions that the alleged hacking was \u201cin furtherance\u201d of two provisions of the Espionage Act involving obtaining and disclosing classified information.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear his defense counsel will jump on those references to violations of the espionage laws and say, \u2018Therefore, he is being sought for extradition for political offenses,\u2019\u201d Bellinger said.\nIn addition, Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. intelligence analyst whom Assange is accused of helping access Defense Department computers, was convicted at a 2013 court-martial on six Espionage Act counts involving classified government reports published by WikiLeaks. And even the hacking charge leveled at Assange on Thursday includes a violation that applies solely to \u201cnational defense\u201d information and tracks closely with wording in the Espionage Act \u2014 one of the key statutes U.S. authorities use to prosecute leaks.\nLegal experts said the use of the hacking charge has a two-fold purpose: helping ease Assange\u2019s extradition by making the central charge sound more like a common crime and trying to reassure journalists and First Amendment advocates that Assange isn\u2019t being prosecuted simply for publishing classified information \u2014 an activity that mainstream news outlets regularly engage in.\n\u201cIt is a rifle shot to steer clear of a case that would worry the average journalist that they could be prosecuted over stories that make it into The New York Times, The Washington Post and POLITICO all the time,\u201d said Ashley Deeks, a University of Virginia law professor.\nThe timing of the charges could also provide fodder for Assange\u2019s defense to fight extradition. The indictment was returned in March 2018 and kept under seal until Thursday. But all the acts mentioned took place in 2010 and virtually all of them were known to the government by the time Manning \u2014 who at the time was known as Army Pfc. Bradley Manning \u2014 went to a pretrial hearing in a military court in 2011.\nThat could fuel arguments that what\u2019s motivating the charges isn\u2019t anything that happened in 2010, but rather events from 2016 that were more overtly political in nature, like WikiLeaks\u2019 role in publishing hacked Democratic Party emails in that year\u2019s presidential election \u2014 and Russia\u2019s alleged involvement in the hack.\nHowever, while many of the allegations against Assange have been public for almost a decade, there remained some ambiguity at Manning\u2019s 2013 court-martial whether Assange was actually the person who had the online exchanges with Manning. Manning said at the time that she suspected she was in touch with Assange or someone close to him but wasn\u2019t really sure.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is evidence that would prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s my assumption \u2014 that they had to get to a level of confidence that they could prove it was Assange who Manning was communicating with,\u201d said Mary McCord, who served in a top post at the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division from 2014 through the early months of the Trump administration.\nOther former officials said they suspect the Obama administration may have been reluctant to bring a case against Assange because of a controversy that erupted in 2013 over the Justice Department\u2019s investigative techniques involving Fox News and Associated Press journalists enmeshed in leak investigations.\nThe imbroglio led Eric Holder, the attorney general at the time, to pledge that no journalist would be prosecuted \u201cfor doing his or her job.\u201d However, McCord said this would not have ruled out a case for hacking, like the one unsealed Thursday against Assange.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thought that when Attorney General Holder said that, he thought their job was to hack into classified computer systems,\u201d said McCord, now a law professor at Georgetown. \u201cI was never in a room where anybody was hand-wringing about that. I don\u2019t think there would have been any hesitation to file a change like that if there was sufficient evidence.\u201d\nAssange\u2019s attorneys are also likely to argue that the relatively modest single-count indictment against him is just a placeholder intended to secure his transfer to the U.S., where he could be hit with more serious charges related to the 2016 election or to obtaining and publishing a set of documents the following year known as \u201cVault 7,\u201d detailing CIA hacking techniques.\nMedia reports on Thursday quoted anonymous U.S. officials saying the charges against Assange could be revised or expanded. In addition, several lawmakers may have complicated Assange\u2019s extradition on the current indictment by publicly suggesting it should be a vehicle to punish him for being a tool of Russia.\n\u201cUnfortunately, whatever Assange\u2019s intentions when he started WikiLeaks, what he\u2019s really become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West and a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said.\nWhile Assange faces a maximum possible penalty of five years in prison on the current charge, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) seemed to be pressing for a far more serious case.\n\u201cJulian Assange has long been a wicked tool of Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence services,\u201d Sasse wrote on Twitter . \u201cHe deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.\u201d\nThe U.S.-U.K. treaty contains provisions aimed at preventing a bait-and-switch, where a suspect is extradited on one set of charges, only to have them swapped for another. But executive branch officials in the U.K. could waive that, leaving the door open to additional or new charges against Assange.\nIt is likely the charges would still have to meet muster under other parts of the treaty, however, so offenses considered political would be off the table.\nIf the U.S. tried to make such a move after obtaining Assange, it\u2019s unclear whether the American courts would step in or leave the issue to Justice Department officials and their counterparts in Britain.\n\u201cWho decides could be important here,\u201d Deeks said.\nShe said Justice Department officials must realize there\u2019s at least some possibility that the British courts turn down the extradition request.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the Trump administration has decided that the juice is worth the squeeze and that even if they don\u2019t get him extradited there\u2019s some chance of succeeding by making a show of disapproval of what he did,\u201d the professor said.\nBellinger, now a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter, said British courts tend to have a broader view of what constitutes political offenses than do American courts. However, he said he would not be surprised if the U.S. and Britain agree or have already agreed to limit the scope of any future charges in order to increase the chances of British courts approving the extradition.\n\u201cIn this case, it may be \u2014 in order to get Assange extradited to the U.S. \u2014 just easier to focus on things the U.S. and U.K. governments can agree on, even if it means leaving some other things off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Trump administration may not be eager to charge him with interference in the election when you\u2019ve got these pre-existing offenses dating back to 2010 with Chelsea Manning. Frankly, this may be a clearer pathway to charges and a conviction.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this article.\nAssange\u2019s camp did not respond to a message seeking comment about strategy for the extradition process, but a legal adviser to Assange said they were gearing up for a fight in the British courts. The adviser, Geoffrey Robertson, also said Thursday that the claim that Assange agreed to aid Manning in hacking a password didn\u2019t transform the case.\n\u201cAny American journalist who would buy a source a cup of coffee would be helping a source,\u201d Robertson said on CNN.\nA British magistrate is expected to consider the extradition request at a hearing set for May 2. Whatever ruling comes out of that hearing could be appealed through the British courts and perhaps even to the European Court of Human Rights. (Despite Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, the U.K. government has agreed to remain under that court\u2019s jurisdiction, at least for now.)\nEven if Assange is brought to the U.S., he could try making many of the same arguments in U.S. courts. So, the seven years of delay he brought on by holing up in the Ecuadorian Embassy could lead to a new chapter that also drags on for years.\n\u201cOne thing is for sure: This will be litigated for a long time,\u201d Bellinger said.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the year Chelsea Manning was was convicted.

And they are threatening to impose more and tens of billions more.\nTrade experts say a shutdown could disrupt the U.S. auto supply chain, putting jobs in jeopardy.\n\"A trade war will become a reality if lawmakers don't resolve the impasse over government funding,\" said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nThe biggest priority is likely to be avoiding a national shutdown at the end of the weekend. In the past three years, all such government shutdowns have cost the U.S. economy $11 billion in lost output.\nThe Trump administration has approved steel and aluminum tariffs, while China has imposed tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. goods.\nThe administration is hoping to at least get a product-by-product deal to end the full-blown trade war before it reaches a full-scale deal with China.\n\"There is a consensus that a deal is possible,\" said Cary Matsuura, a U.S. trade and manufacturing expert at the University of Notre Dame. \"They can't get to final status without legislation.\"\nBut while there is a deal on steel and aluminum, that has to be passed by Congress.\nMany Republicans say they are not willing to give up on China without getting something in return.\nSo far the two sides have tried to negotiate through the World Trade Organization, although that avenue has some limits.\nAlready, the Trump administration has sought to push forward without Congress \u2014 a move that would not require approval from lawmakers \u2014 by letting Chinese companies pay tariffs on goods subject to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Those efforts have had mixed results.\nThe U.S. also sought to get some of the duties waived by the WTO, but the appeals panel rejected the U.S. request. That's a key stumbling block: It means China can largely afford to ignore the Trump administration's moves.\nA comprehensive deal with China is likely needed to preserve U.S. access to China's financial and technology markets. But that would require breaking up the U.S. market to Beijing and its state-owned enterprises.\n\"A deal will have to be comprehensive. If you don't get a complete break with state-owned enterprises, you will be compromised,\" said a trade adviser to the Treasury Department who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nSome trade experts believe Congress is unlikely to shut down the government over the auto issue, partly because it would anger the powerful Trump administration wing of the Republican Party.\nSome Democrats may also find it difficult to object because they would suffer political backlash if they would shut down the government over this one issue.\n", "domain": "politico.com", "title": "U.S. and Chinese companies fear Trump\u2019s coming trade war on car industry", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Adam Behsudi, Andrew Desiderio, Sarah Ferris, Finbarr Bermingham, South China Morning Post", "ind30k": 9960, "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/17/us-china-trade-car-industry-1358959", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

They are big enough to suck in all the matter in their radius with relatively little mass lost during the process. With this black hole, the team saw a relatively small neutron star, which is 60 million kilometres away from the sun, and a newly born black hole, which is 45 to 50 million kilometres away from the sun.\n\"There are many ways to produce black holes on the sun, but most are very common. None of the processes on our star, which lies just a few million kilometres away, have produced such a small black hole,\" Farrell said.\nThe scientists were able to spot the star from afar because it is very bright, shining about 45 times brighter than a hydrogen atom. The red-shifted signal from this early stage of material falling into the black hole came from six years of observations, according to the study. After this black hole was caught on camera, the astronomers analyzed the matter that made up the dense mass of the early black hole and its molecular gas.\nThe analysis showed that the molecular gas was just one per cent molecular nitrogen and about four per cent oxygen. The researchers concluded that, around the edges of the black hole, almost all the matter was hydrogen, producing the fractionally more dense nuclear fusion chamber. \"This discovery suggests that the energetic material remaining behind in the new black hole is very different than in the initial cloud of matter,\" Farrell said.\nThe researchers believe that the new monster black hole that appeared on Keck I was almost certainly created at some point in its stellar life. \"We hope to learn more about this celestial observatory, Keck I, and possibly discover new supermassive black holes lurking there that will one day collide with each other,\" Farrell said.\nCatch up on all the latest Crime, National, International and Hatke news here.

{"article": "Black holes are some of the most awesome things in the Universe, and are some of the most powerful objects. Whether this is due to the interaction between a black hole and a star, or the major particles spewed into space upon black hole discovery, no explanation can be given. Many scientists have said that a black hole is likely to destroy itself in such a destructive fashion. Though not a reality, scientists have made progress in spotting black holes which can absorb far light sources.\nWhat would happen if the Earth went into a black hole? Similar to the problems associated with shrinking quasars, black holes also consume enormous amounts of energy - on a much larger scale. A black hole is an infinitely dense region in space, swallowing anything and everything in its path. Some black holes can be so concentrated that they can even bring down stars to the point of no return.

Earlier this year, astronomers confirmed the first known instance of a planet orbiting a black hole. Called HD 85512b, the planet has been around its black hole for 1,900 years, but its natural lifespan is only thought to be 10,000 years.

{"article": "Fishing boats, Bodega Bay, California. (Chris Marshall / CNS)\n(CN) \u2013 Pacific sardines, the small, oily fish favored by salmon, baleen whales and toothed whales, have had their population collapsed by 98 percent since 2006, according to the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, which on Friday formerly declared the West Coast population overfished.\nThe designation means that the council will soon have 15 months to come up with a plan to rebuild sardine populations, and the plan must be implemented within two years. Even so, live bait fishing and previous levels of bycatch can legally continue, because the National Marine Fisheries Service says the current fishing plan already has measures in place to prevent overfishing.\nPacific sardines are a schooling feast for many ocean creatures. They are eaten by salmon, tuna, sharks, sea birds, seals and sea lions. But the highest numbers by far are consumed by toothed whales and baleen whales \u2013 creatures whose own populations are in some cases recovering from historic lows and in other cases still in decline.\nSouthern resident killer whales, who also make their habitat amid the West Coast with Pacific sardines, were afforded habitat protection by the fisheries service on Friday. A separate Washington state bill passed by that state\u2019s legislators on Friday would also increase the safety of oil shipping in their habitat in order to protect the killer whales, who number at just 75.\nNumbers of Pacific sardine dropped dramatically in 2013 and have continued to slowly decline since then, according to an assessment from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Numbers have been below the threshold to regular commercial fishing for the last three years.\nCalifornia charter boat fisherman James Gardner disagreed with the agency assessment.\n\u201cI would like to state for the record that the volume of sardines in the local waters from La Jolla to Dana Point has increased dramatically in recent years,\u201d Gardner told the council. \u201cFish congregate in areas where the condition they like is right and the condition here has improved and the sardine stock is strong.\u201d\nThat contention was contradicted by government numbers, which show that the total biomass of Pacific sardines amounts to 27,547 metric tons of fish \u2013 well below the 150,000 metric ton threshold to allow commercial fishing and a far cry from the 1.8 million metric tons scientists estimated in 2006.\nThe council also mulled changing the designation from \u201coverfished,\u201d which suggests that the problem is caused by fishing alone, to a term that reflects poor ocean conditions caused by climate change.\nLifelong commercial fisherman Butch Smith cited drought, warming ocean temperatures and natural cycles of abundance and decline as additional reasons for the collapse of sardine numbers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a word we need changed for many reasons,\u201d Smith told Courthouse News. \u201cSardines are overfished and yet they haven\u2019t been fished for four years. We\u2019ll step up to the plate and tie our boats to the dock when we have to, but that word tends to take the spotlight off the real issues.\u201d\nThat frustrated Ben Enticknap, senior scientist with Oceana. Reached by phone at the meeting in Rohnert Park, California, where he testified before the council, Enticknap told Courthouse News that government agencies have refused for years to accept that sardine fishing makes problems caused by climate change worse.\n\u201cSardines are heavily influenced by the environment, but also the fishing rates have been unsustainable, so that drives the population down sooner,\u201d Enticknap said. \u201cThey just ignored it for as long as they possibly could.\u201d\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "domain": "courthousenews.com", "title": "Pacific Sardines at Risk as Their Numbers are Overfished", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "Karina Brown", "ind30k": 3677, "url": "https://www.courthousenews.com/pacific-sardines-at-risk-as-their-numbers-are-overfished/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.4052484786352611}
{"article": "By Saleem Qamar Butt\nIt is amazing that Pakistan-Russia strategic partnership is a fusion of two countries and a strategic realm. The difference between the two countries\u2019 approaches to the situation in South Asia has rendered the bilateral relationship impossible till about 30 years.\nThe Sino-Soviet relations were transposed into the Pakistan-China relationship. The expected failure of the Chinese economic diplomacy and US pivot to Asia put China and Russia together as against the US and its various diplomatic allies who were pursuing the counter-alliance in China\u2019s place. In this scenario, Pakistan and Russia were the two alluring powers in South Asia where India and the United States were the two effective belligerents. Their strategic alliance had a devastating effect on Pakistan\u2019s vital national interests and our foreign policy made the country a prisoner of the strategic triangle and not able to manoeuvre effectively.\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the regional and global equations. The opening up of the Indian Ocean, which has been the motive behind the America\u2019s pivot to Asia, has come as an enabler to the China-Russia Strategic Partnership. Pakistan is reorienting its foreign policy towards China and to Russia. Pakistan has already won enormous diplomatic dividends in the past in the form of economic cooperation and development aid but now, it seems that Russia has much more interest in the Strategic depth of Pakistan in the region. The establishment of an independent, stable and robust nuclear weapons and missile systems has also changed the strategic equations of the region and has allowed us to engage in constructive relations with the United States.\nPakistan\u2019s development assistance to Russia was never conceived as an American ploy, but a manifestation of our interest to build our defense preparedness. While India and the United States have a long history of strategic cooperation and deep-rooted economic links, Russia and Pakistan have almost no relations.\nThe relations have never reached beyond economic cooperation, long term strategic partnership between the two countries and trade. It was only in recent times, that former US Secretary of State, Mr Rex Tillerson, visited Russia on March 19-20, 2018. It was the first visit by a US official to Russia in two decades, since the \u2018friendly relations\u2019 between Russia and the United States were terminated after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. At the end of his visit, Rex Tillerson delivered a speech about the US President\u2019s foreign policy and strategy to promote a more robust US leadership in the world.\nThe Russians have raised the demand for military assistance from Pakistan at the multilateral military exhibitions held in various countries and on occasions when we are in urgent need of that assistance. These gestures reflect that Russia wishes to be engaged on a permanent basis.\nPakistan, on the other hand, holds full-fledged consultations with United States in the backdrop of volatile security situation in the region. The Security Council has also given its consent to restore Pakistan\u2019s Permanent Membership on the Security Council.\nThe bilateral Sino-US relations improved considerably in the past three years and the US has a huge political interest in the Indo-Pacific pivot, designed to counter China\u2019s Silk Road and Belt project. The US intervention in the South Asian affairs which is coming on the back of the establishment of the fabled Quad-China-Japan-Pakistan-Russia trilateral summit (which is aimed at regional peace and stability) will seriously damage Pakistan\u2019s strategic interests and we will have to find solutions to these problems.\nWe have started negotiations with United States for the full restoration of Pakistan\u2019s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) after their boycott at the previous SAARC Summit in Islamabad. The parliament passed a law in February 2019 which provided immunity to the scientists who developed the Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons program. We have also formally notified United States of Pakistan\u2019s willingness to join the US made Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor (IPEC) and secure the strategic Karachi, Lahore and Gwadar ports. These agreements would help Pakistan put the US pressure on other regional powers by securing its economic future.\nAll this shows that Pakistan wants to reintegrate into the world community.\n", "domain": "dailytimes.com.pk", "title": "Pakistan-Russia strategic relationship", "date": "April 14, 2019", "authors": "Saleem Qamar Butt", "ind30k": 3677, "url": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/376844/pakistan-russia-strategic-relationship/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "The 1st quarter of 2008 and the 1st quarter of 2012 indicate a change in the trend of recession probabilities in recessions. 2010, 2011, and 2012 all experienced economic expansion and thus no risk of a recession.\nBetween April and June, the odds of a recession or a major financial market event will go up. May and June have been more prone to large reductions in the probability of recession than April through December in recent years.\nTake the risk of economic contraction from the risk of a market event out of the equation, and it becomes very difficult to determine whether a recession has started.\nI consider only the four major reports that make our national economic portrait: PCE, ECRI, the St. Louis Fed's GDPNow model, and the Employment Situation Summary report.\nThe personal consumption expenditures, the Empire State, Philadelphia, and Kansas City Fed Bank surveys indicate an increase in future economic growth. The latest ECRI recession call, and the weekly past revision for the revised civilian employment situation report indicated a steep decline in the payroll employment picture.\nSource: US Dept. of Commerce\nIf we substitute the payroll employment number (including the trend of all private employment) for the unemployment rate (using the monthly trend of all net employment), it falls from a 7.0% level today to 6.2% in 2012. This number was down from 7.4% in 2006 when the 2nd presidential election of George W. Bush took place.\nStill, when factoring in the unemployment rate adjusted for the percentage of people working part-time while looking for full-time employment (bad labor market impact, by the way), the labor force participation rate has not recovered.\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nThe labor participation rate has been falling steadily since 2004, and these statistics include new American labor force entrants since the economic recession began.\nEmployment growth in the 1st quarter of 2013 will be weak. I am using the latest in the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers. The number of employed was approximately 12.5 million jobs at the end of the first quarter, while the unemployment rate was 7.6%.\nData provided by the BLS, and prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nWhat we do know is that these data points for April report new strength, following a weak March. Since January, the rates of growth for both employment and the overall economy has been very disappointing.\nRegarding the \"real economy,\" the other data includes the Gross Domestic Product estimate from the National Bureau of Economic Research, the University of Michigan and The Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators.\nDue to many of the forecasters missing the recession, there is no consensus on when the recession will occur, and therefore the risk of an event remains high.\nThe risks to the consumer are twofold: high gas prices that might increase real expenditures, and low savings rates of savings. Due to the high rate of inflation, long-term savings rate of debt might fall sharply.\nThere are two big risk factors: the adoption of a negative policy bias in Federal Reserve policy and an increased likelihood of a financial event.\nWith the Fed in an \"easy money\" mode, I am buying commodities and investing in miners.\nFor a couple of hours on Friday, I had an in-depth conversation with my best friend.

{"article": "Wide receiver ArDarius Stewart. Defensive tackle Tulane's Greg Gilmore. While these are some potential selections that intrigue Eagles fans, there is another defensive playmaker who is available in the early stages of Round 1 that might be even more interesting.\nSafety Nasir Adderley is an interesting prospect, in large part because he can cover tight ends in the passing game.\nAt 6-foot-1 and 204 pounds, Adderley should project as a strong safety in a nickel set. If he is a top-25 selection, he could be deployed in the slot. What makes Adderley intriguing, however, is the fact that he can cover tight ends in the passing game.\nBecause of his size and his versatility, Adderley could transition well to an offensive role, though he doesn't possess the ideal size to be a traditional tight end. He is a physical, downhill runner who is solid in coverage.\nIn his college career, Adderley played mainly safety. He spent time at corner, as well, and that versatility is what makes him appealing as a safety prospect. At his best, Adderley played both box and slot back-up roles and stayed largely healthy throughout his career.\nThe Eagles were fortunate to land Malcolm Jenkins in the first round in 2007. They didn't necessarily miss out on Chris Maragos, which is a good thing. If the team is looking for a similar safety option that has a deep transition path in the secondary, it could see the value in Adderley.\nThe Eagles will have other needs this year at defensive back. They might also take a quarterback (for the first time since Donovan McNabb) or a cornerback at some point during the draft.\nWould a strong safety be a better fit for the Eagles?

{"article": "The subject of domestic violence comes to mind often when I see the large banners with pictures of domestic violence victims. The women and children subjected to abusive relationships of every kind are carried everywhere - in public places and malls, on billboards, and inside newspapers.\nWhat is not often mentioned, though, is that some of these victims are police officers. Domestic violence against the officers is just as insidious, and often society seems unaware of this aspect of the issue.\nMembers of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) are disproportionately more likely to be victims of abuse and violence than any other profession in Jamaica. Women in the service are up to nine times more likely to experience intimate partner violence than the general population, while males in the service are five times more likely to experience intimate partner violence than the general population.\nPlea-bargaining reform\nIt is true that Jamaica does not have equal protection of the law in the prevention and prosecution of domestic violence. While the law allows for the conviction of those who use physical, mental, and psychological violence against their partners and cohabitants, the rate of conviction of domestic violence offences is very low in Jamaica. This is because of a number of reasons.\nTwo, Jamaica's dispensation of personal injury damages was limited to malicious injury or injury of a material nature. Anyone in Jamaica can be an insurance company or an individual actor with a financial incentive to cheat people. Two, in Jamaica, each entity is free to investigate, litigate, and defend individuals in all kinds of cases, including personal injury cases.\nA third reason is that police officers who complain about or report domestic violence are themselves victims of domestic violence. This is the majority of cases. Police officers report domestic violence only when it injures them and if they are believed by the other parties.\nThe term 'victim' needs to be changed because of the well-documented prevalence of police officers being abused. In the JCF, there are 260 current victims of domestic violence. Of these 260 victims, 27 victims were females. Twelve of these female victims are officers. Of the 250 male victims, 180 were police officers.\nIf the testimonies of victims of domestic violence with any class of occupation and profession are to be believed, then 26 per cent of the general population would be reported as victims. Of those who report as victims, 58 per cent do so because they are scared, and 35 per cent because they have been hurt.\nRisks to health\nSeveral other health risks emerge from domestic violence.\nBeing a police officer is one of them. When victims of domestic violence report to the police, it affects their health because they will not be able to go to work and so lose potential income.\nPardons and releases make it harder for victims to access health care. According to a release from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, victims of domestic violence have to request urgent medical care from the local police station or to have their needs assessed by a nurse and a doctor before they can be released from custody. A nurse or doctor cannot decide how long the crime victims should be held at the station.\nPolicemen are frequent witnesses of domestic violence. But as described above, nearly half of domestic violence incidents are reported to police and suspects are not arrested, charged, or convicted.\nPolice officers are missing sick days to facilitate domestic violence and may be on duty and feeling sick or mentally distressed when they witness it. Domestic violence is the leading cause of workplace absenteeism, so when a worker is absent for a number of days because of domestic violence, it is likely that the employer will notice and deduct time for absenteeism.\nThese risks have been reported in multiple jurisdictions.\nAccording to research conducted by the United States Attorney General's Office, 79 per cent of police officers reported that they had experienced domestic violence or had had a relative who had experienced domestic violence.\nStudies have also reported that more than 10 per cent of victims of domestic violence were police officers. One study found that female police officers were three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence. Another study found that police officers are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the general population.\nDomestic violence against police officers is prevalent and should not be treated as a stereotype. It should be treated as a serious issue that needs to be addressed.\n\u2022 Sgt Shermen Nixon is an analyst with the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication (CARIMAC) and an adjunct lecturer in the School of Information and Communication Technology at the University of the West Indies.\n", "domain": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "title": "Domestic violence and the victims", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 6762, "url": "http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/letters/20190416/domestic-violence-and-victims", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "The poll was done in response to Justin Trudeau\u2019s absurd announcement on Wednesday that any woman who uses protection during sex, both men and women, have a right to a free trial.\nThe Prime Minister said he was getting practical and introducing legislation to \u201censure that people who are forced to have sex against their will won\u2019t be falsely accused or prosecuted.\u201d\nNever mind that, considering sex slavery is an actual violent crime, it is not an incidence of a crime that will be avoided by the Liberal government\u2019s help.\nSince sex is dirty and damaging and not always consensual, a prosecution is hardly justified \u2014 \u201cremedy\u201d is the wrong word \u2014 by laws that make it illegal to force someone into such a position.\nBut when laws are followed only when we agree with them, why is there any defence? After all, a great deal of nastiness is done by those of our own choosing. Are we to blame if they get offended?\nThis is where the truth of the Liberal prime minister comes into play. For a lot of people in his caucus, I can\u2019t say I really believe they mean what they say.\nThey might, to some extent, if that was their only goal. But it\u2019s not that simple. The first component in any plan to place people under the thumb of some government is political purpose. This, along with the fact they don\u2019t want to pay for themselves.\nWe are constantly asked what exactly this Liberal government stands for. At a rally at the University of Calgary on Wednesday, Trudeau made the case that his position was very much grounded in truth.\n\u201cWe know that sexual violence is rampant. Statistics show that up to 50 per cent of all assaults are not reported. One in three women is sexually assaulted during her lifetime and we know some of the barriers to reporting can be caused by fear of the consequences.\u201d\nAs early as February, Trudeau vowed he would put money toward setting up a national plan to protect women.\nSo here we are, just four months later and we are going back to the old \u201cthere\u2019s always someone better\u201d argument.\nWhat we aren\u2019t getting is how to deter attackers when they know they can commit a crime and get away with it. The macho bullies are the solution. But the proof of the imbecility of the mentality that sees only the best in men is found in sex crime victims and the fact they are largely ignored.\nOur readers know this to be a case-by-case inquiry. We have shown repeatedly this year that witnesses are intimidated, abused and intimidated. Victims are pressured into silence. And in cases that do go to trial, the justice system falls apart and the accused is acquitted and released from jail.\nBrent Rathgeber, a Conservative MP, resigned from Parliament earlier this year, also after refusing to make it easy for a judge to justify why a man \u2014 who was convicted of serious sexual assaults \u2014 should be released while his accusers remained in jail.\nIt is high time for a government to create policies to protect sexual victims. Whether Liberals will do so \u2014 in the way of the party\u2019s incessant talk of national unity \u2014 is anyone\u2019s guess.\nSome will say this is a call to make women safer.

In \u201cHarvest,\u201d Erin West\u2019s first film, director and writer Raul Campos has a guest writer ask us to look past the platters of food in a restaurant and think about how we want to feel when a person we don\u2019t know is feeling ashamed about his or her food choices. The film parallels that spirit, when they watch a person on hunger strikes in prison, and tell the story of struggles and victories around food, family and hope.\nThis film was picked up by NBC Owned TV Stations for broadcast.\nNot all the films come from foreign filmmakers, as \u201cSanctuary\u201d gives us the opportunity to see Latino faces in a role that, usually, we only see in certain movies. Up-and-coming filmmakers Katie Pickell and Nick Walczak\u2019s first film celebrates the stories of other vulnerable and disenfranchised groups of people, from LGBTQ people to women to immigrants.\n\u201cProtect,\u201d which was written and directed by Carlos Cruz and Micaela Soria, is inspired by an actual social media movement with the same name. Using what\u2019s in front of their eyes, they tell of a teenager who sees his life as a digital billboard that he has to fix on a constant basis. And he feels isolated because of that.\nHosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Film and Media, the festival will showcase 12 new films from writers, directors and producers who have largely been overlooked by industry awards. The festival is co-organized by the Associated Hispanic Film Directors (AHFD) and features filmmakers as ambassadors in Chicago and international publications.\n\u201cUnited Against Hunger,\u201d is a series of shorts about immigration, the LGBTQ community, food and spirituality.

Judging by a new set of rumours we have to report, Apple's position on components \u2014 and therefore the designs and software that support them \u2014 may change, in ways that consumers will like.\nThe latest rumours come from MMI News, with TechReviewer and iPhone in the 90s also chipping in. Mostly it's iPhone 6 rumours and supporting specs, with an upgrade to the Touch ID button potentially the primary catch for the iPhone 6S. What's more interesting is that MMI News suggests that Apple is planning to include some previously-deployed components from Samsung \u2014 what's more, they expect the tech to come in hardware that will allow Apple to offer an edge-to-edge smartphone.\niMore has reported in the past that Samsung's 3600Mhz modem chipset from earlier this year will make its way into the iPhone 6S. The magazine's source is a supply chain partner, so we'll reserve judgement until Apple officially decides to use a Samsung part, and when. Previous rumours had Apple's massive 2560 x 1440 Retina display unit said to come from Sharp, but now Sharp has some new problems in its return to growth (around a 12 per cent gross margin) and MMI News says that Sharp is supplying Samsung with a 5500Mhz modem instead.\nSometime between August and September, MMI News says, Samsung will also start supplying Apple with three of its latest reference designs for thin cell batteries, the best-performing architecture in the mass consumer marketplace. Apple has previously only used Samsung reference designs for display and camera modules, so a move into thinner, more power-efficient batteries is a logical thing for Apple to do.\nCuriously enough, MMI says that it knows of no apparent motives for Samsung to be involved in the new joint projects.

Is John Cena wrestling again?\nIt seems as if everybody is talking about what WWE has planned for WrestleMania 35, and there is always big news, but rumors are swirling around as well. A lot of things are rumored but they are all going to be broken down at a later date, but in the meantime, fans are still wondering if The Undertaker and John Cena will be there at all. Both superstars are still rumored to be in action, but who is coming out on top for the night?\nRecently, WWE announced two events that will take place on Saturday, April 6, 2019, as part of WrestleMania Weekend. There are two incredible shows taking place with WWE and Ring of Honor\u2019s \u201cSlammiversary\u201d taking place at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and a few other big announcements are going to come soon.\nThis weekend will also see WWE Extreme Rules happening, which will also have some surprise matches and battles. WWE is trying to throw an awful lot of hype around this weekend with John Cena, The Undertaker, and Brock Lesnar all appearing on the card, but the above will be broken down in a more in-depth way later.\nIn the meantime, it is only logical to wonder if any of these three guys will be doing a match on April 7, 2019.\nWWE\nFor now, we know The Undertaker and John Cena are all going to be on hand at WrestleMania 35. There have been discussions about The Undertaker possibly showing up on Raw or SmackDown in a bigger role, but nothing is set in stone yet.\nBrock Lesnar will also be there for WrestleMania 35 in some capacity, but there has been some confusion over what he could be doing. As recently reported by Inquisitr, it is believed that the WWE Universal Champion might be going to Mexico and helping out the main event of the event.\nThere are no current plans for The Undertaker to appear at any of the three events (WrestleMania Weekend, Extreme Rules, or Brock Lesnar), but \u201cThe Deadman\u201d is still rumored to be there. On Twitter, Wrestling Inc. has posted a look at the rumored titles for The Undertaker at WrestleMania 35, and there are a lot of them.\nIt was suggested that the title would be The Phenom, The Trinity, or The Heartbreak Kid.\nOf course, The Undertaker did cut a promo on the main panel on Monday Night Raw last week to make people wonder if he would be showing up. The Deadman talked about retirement, but did also say that all he has to do to end it all is win again. That\u2019s not all he said as seen below.\nWWE\nJohn Cena has pretty much been gone for months, but he will be expected to show up at WrestleMania 35 for the marquee battle royal. There is no word on whether he will face one of the major challengers in the match or be a part of it as well. Even if he\u2019s in the battle royal, it\u2019s been speculated that he may not return to television until the very next night on SmackDown.\nWWE\nOne name not listed as part of any of the matches for WrestleMania 35, but still expected to be there, is Brock Lesnar. As reported by The Inquisitr, there has been talk of Lesnar appearing on SmackDown Live to help out the event and potentially perform in a match. Regardless of if he\u2019s going to end his run or not, he is expected to be at the event in some way.\nAt this point, a lot of rumors are flying around on where these WWE superstars will appear at WrestleMania 35, but there\u2019s still a lot to be worked out. John Cena, The Undertaker, and Brock Lesnar will be there, and they all have their purpose in one way or another. There is still time for some surprise rivalries to be set up and announcements will happen before the weekend, but a lot is still unknown about what is going to take place on April 7, 2019.\n", "domain": "inquisitr.com", "title": "WWE Rumors: Big Updates On The Status Of The Undertaker And John Cena For \u2018WrestleMania 35\u2019", "date": "April 05, 2019", "authors": "Danny Cox", "ind30k": 2471, "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5378636/wwe-rumors-big-updates-on-the-undertaker-and-john-cenas-status-for-wrestlemania-35/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell looks over the opening statement for the Hurricane Sandy Supplemental Appropriations Act during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 26, 2013. | AP Photo/Susan Walsh Senate fails to advance disaster aid package amid Puerto Rico clash\nThe Senate on Monday night declined to take up a $29 billion disaster aid package for states recovering from recent hurricanes, heartened by fierce opposition from Republicans concerned about Puerto Rico's debt and struggling infrastructure.\nThe move was not surprising given the absence of the legislation from the chamber's agenda. After spending the better part of the weekend shuttling back and forth between the Capitol and Puerto Rico, Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the bill would likely come to the floor this week.\nStory Continued Below\nThe vote was coming after it became clear that the $29 billion disaster aid package might not be enough to address immediate needs. President Donald Trump had earlier estimated the legislation would be approximately $35 billion, but senators pushed back on his count. At the White House briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stood by the $35 billion figure.\nSome Senate Republicans have been concerned that including billions for Puerto Rico will put too much pressure on a White House looking to refocus its attention on debt payments and infrastructure repairs. In a letter to Ryan, seven House Republicans argued that the aid package is a waste of money and that any disaster aid bill should be limited to states that have already declared states of emergency.\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The aid package is expected to raise the overall contribution to disaster relief to $75 billion.\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

His state, Alabama, was struck by Hurricane Michael last month.\nSome of the objections focus on Puerto Rico, where the island's economic meltdown has hit the island hard and caused widespread damage to roads, bridges and other public infrastructure.\nA spokesman for McConnell, Don Stewart, downplayed concerns about the aid package, saying, \"The Republicans who are holding up the bill are concerned about Puerto Rico's debt, infrastructure and living standards. Anyone can argue that on a given day, but there's nothing in this bill that will specifically go to Puerto Rico. The bill will be directed to the White House and we believe that their budget office can address those concerns.\"\nBut other Republican senators voiced concerns that they want to ensure the disaster aid package actually goes to areas most in need and isn't used for other purposes.\n\"I'm not seeing the connection. Why is a $35 billion package going to Puerto Rico? They need immediate relief because they've been pretty much forgotten by Congress,\" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said.\nBlunt, a member of the Appropriations Committee, argued that many Puerto Ricans have been waiting since 2016 for aid to help rebuild.\n\"There are some ... who would say, 'Why are you now providing $30 billion to the poorest state of the union when you're providing aid for hurricanes?'\" Blunt said. \"I don't understand the debate except the people are trying to apply a political calculus to this.\"\nOther critics, however, point to Puerto Rico's dire fiscal condition. It owes $73 billion to creditors.\n\"This does not make sense,\" said Sen.

{"article": "DUBAI: Uber set out its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on Friday, saying it would bring a new generation of modern technology to mobility and \u201cignite opportunity\u201d for its drivers.\nThe IPO, which would be the first for a major US tech company in almost a decade, would more than double the value of the beleaguered American ride-hailing giant to more than $120 billion, placing it comfortably ahead of rival Lyft, which is aiming for an IPO later this year.\nThe IPO is the latest milestone in the transformation of Uber into a global logistics player, and a transition from being a product which passengers in their own cars used to request, to being a self-driving car platform.\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the new, digital world was also one where using its app would no longer be enough.\n\u201cGoing forward, we need to be much more committed to building our communities in every corner of the world and ultimately be a better and safer place,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe ride-hailing business was already valued at around $69 billion when it was bought by Japan\u2019s SoftBank, an investor which had previously forced drastic changes including the departure of founder Travis Kalanick.\nSoftBank, which along with other investors is planning to buy $3 billion worth of shares from employees, is now keen to take the business public \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d but has yet to announce a target date for the IPO.\nUber has been on a quest to better satisfy the interests of drivers and give them the benefits of technology.\nBut the world\u2019s biggest ride-hailing company, which has been rocked by scandals that have damaged its reputation, has not been able to shake the image of being a vehicle of the rich and powerful who have effectively cashed in.\nJust over 4 million drivers around the world make $15 billion a year, giving them more than 9 million driver jobs and more than $70 billion in net earnings, the company said in its IPO prospectus.\nAn Uber DASH car, UberEATS delivery vans, UberAUTO car and delivery vans are parked in Berlin, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017. (AP)\nSuch strong numbers are the business case that Uber has submitted to its shareholders as it prepares to hold its IPO, the firm said in its IPO filing.\nBut the company is also competing for more and more drivers, with some European and North American cities moving to regulate an industry which is now at the heart of the urban transportation and logistics industries.\nAnother headache for Uber is in its autonomous cars division, which has seen multiple accidents involving its trucks, cars and taxis in recent years.\nDespite turning a corner in driverless technology in recent years, and hiring electric-car pioneer Elaine Zhuk as its first CEO for the division, the company remains far from bringing autonomous cars to market, many analysts said.\nThe date of the IPO will be driven by the company\u2019s investor syndicate, Uber said in the filing. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUber\u2019s 2018 turnover was around $27 billion and the business had $69 billion in assets at the end of last year, according to its preliminary IPO prospectus.\nOn a net basis, its valuation was around $81 billion when it bought its Japanese rivals from SoftBank in June.\nUber\u2019s primary revenue comes from bookings made by passengers, who have no voice or human interaction with the driver. Uber does not face a margin problem because it is cheaper to dispatch its riders than hire drivers.\nAbout 80 percent of the company\u2019s drivers are independent contractors and therefore not part of its wage pool.\nThe company makes its money mainly by charging drivers an incentive fee, plus advertising and fuel and usage charges. About three-quarters of its revenue is from commissions on bookings.\nIt also earns about $1 billion a year by levying a $1 a ride for rides in which passengers use its flat $1.50 per ride fare pricing.\n", "domain": "arabnews.com", "title": "Uber sets IPO in motion, seeks to \u2018ignite opportunity\u2019", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 7004, "url": "http://www.arabnews.com/node/1481311/business-economy", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "Central and Eastern Pennsylvania have nearly a half dozen nuclear plants -- and more nuclear plants may be needed to maintain the electricity system.\nSo should there be a bail-out for them, or an expansion of the current state program to help them?\nThat's what the Public Utility Commission is wrestling with as it prepares to consider new-nuclear costs for industrial customers.\nThe question first hit the public and political radar last year when FirstEnergy Corp., operator of three of Pennsylvania's largest nuclear plants, filed a petition to add its Davis-Besse facility in northern Ohio to the state's Public Assistance Program.\nThat petition has not been resolved and both sides have not been able to negotiate a separate settlement agreement with TMI's second generation operator, Exelon Corp.\nThe first things this new program faces is the question of how, exactly, to deal with the capital costs of Pennsylvania's 20-plus reactors.\nThe top priority for us is to see if the state's utility providers are successful in helping us ... The other guys are here to make money, they're under a different, unique situation. - Exelon spokesman Mark Delmar\n\"The top priority for us is to see if the state's utility providers are successful in helping us out,\" Exelon spokesman Mark Delmar said Wednesday, \"and, hopefully, they can help us extend Davis-Besse and help us assist with refueling outages.\"\nJ. Michael Stump, FirstEnergy's CEO, told state senators on Tuesday that his company is in fact seeking a five-year extension for its assistance program, while also asking PUC officials to charge former Davis-Besse customers to help pay for that extension.\nAccording to the company, that will take the form of so-called \"feed-in fees\" that will be added to customers' utility bills for the next five years.\nTo date, the state's Public Assistance Program does not include a charge that applies to residential ratepayers for help with the costs of fuel.\nFirstEnergy's Davis-Besse plant will operate until 2021, with refueling outages scheduled for twice a year. It's estimated the subsidy would average about $60 a month for residential customers who currently are paying about $73.60 under the state assistance program.\nOther nuclear plant owners have taken different paths, with the Canton-based Public Service Enterprise Group LLC, which also owns several other nuclear facilities in Pennsylvania, announcing in January it was suspending its Pennsylvania participation in the program, effective June 30.\nPSEG cited lower carbon fuel prices from Ohio-based FirstEnergy Solutions Corp., after that company filed for bankruptcy protection and shut down its plants there in 2015.\nPSEG, citing market economics, also reduced its regular support of the two twin-reactor Beaver Valley Generating Station near Shippingport, as well as Allentown's PPL Lehigh Valley Generating Station.\nAll of that was part of a broader strategy by the Northeast region of PSEG's parent company to pare back its nuclear generation in response to the wholesale power market's competitive pressures.\n\"Just like customers in the PJM region pay upwards of $100 per month for electricity on their bill, nuclear generators are seeing a decrease in market value and that has had an impact on our ability to provide needed electricity at an affordable price for customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\" PSEG spokesman Jeffrey Weir said Wednesday.\nExelon in its own filing, is asking the PUC to recognize that the state program provides \"special service to a few select customers in need that will no longer be provided.\"\nWhile there is no rate relief component to the program, that would remove the traditional argument from opponents that the state has nothing to gain from financial support for a company that cannot afford to operate its plants.\nThe utility could then cite reduced returns on its capital investments as its incentive.\n\"We should be comparing this to wholesale market costs. This is no different than subsidizing electric costs for an individual resident of a community if they have a gas company who's been taking advantage of them,\" said Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre County.\n\"So the business model that's being pursued for utilities in Pennsylvania is an ethically challenged business model if it's not just an economically challenged business model,\" Corman added.\nPunishing Exelon and other owners, Corman added, would not only send a bad message to the nuclear industry, but would also hurt ratepayers because the legislation is unlikely to be paid for.\n\"It's a very open question as to what the PUC will be able to determine as it goes through these proceedings,\" Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson County, said.\nOther PUC members were not taking questions after Tuesday's meeting, so details about their", "domain": "pennlive.com", "title": "Should Pennsylvanians pay more to subsidize TMI and other nuclear plants?", "date": "April 03, 2019", "authors": "Charles Thompson", "ind30k": 8906, "url": "https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/04/reactor-reactions-new-bill-emerges-to-subsidize-pennsylvanias-nuclear-fleet.html", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

However, sales of physical media like DVDs and Blu-ray discs have been trending down for years, and Amazon is looking to the cloud to offset that.\nIncreasing their video inventory\nAmazon is currently selling more than 20,000 movies and TV shows in its digital video store, and Bezos sees that number rising significantly as more and more Prime members sign up.\nAt F8, Amazon announced a new pricing structure for Prime Instant Video rentals. Currently, the cost for renting a video for 14 days is $0.99. Starting this month, Prime Instant Video rentals are priced at $1.99, $2.99, or $3.99 for standard definition, high definition, and 4K Ultra HD, respectively. Prime subscribers also have access to streaming episodes of their favorite shows at no additional cost.\nAmazon's additional price for rentals has no impact on its already established price for sales of physical media, which is $0.99 for HD quality and $1.29 for SD quality.\nThe increase is another sign that Amazon sees the value in investing in content. The more content Amazon has on Prime Instant Video, the more interested it becomes in keeping customers in its ecosystem, and the more valuable Prime Instant Video becomes.\nVideo sales on the rise\nAmazon's sales of physical media in its digital video store have been trending downward for a long time. Amazon reported that its top 5 sellers in its physical video store were GameStop's (NYSE:GME) new and used used videogames, as well as rentals from the rental site rentalliquidator.com.\nGamestop does its part to drive sales of physical media. Earlier this year, it revamped its entire business, trying to take the company from \"selling to play\" into \"selling to play.\" It's now taking other retail outlets like Wal-Mart and Target to court, introducing sales at every one of its stores, including electronics and automotive departments. Gamestop has reduced the cost of its basic gaming and non-gaming media in an effort to encourage people to purchase it from them.\nUnlike Gamestop, Amazon keeps customers from buying physical media from physical retailers. It turns them into Prime Instant Video renters with its new pricing structure.\nVideo streaming and Amazon Prime\nAmazon's Prime Instant Video and other content, like Instant Video and Prime Music, are driving Amazon's customers to purchase more stuff from the company.\nAmazon has good reason to encourage customers to add more things to their Amazon Prime accounts. The company also benefits by advertising to Prime members who are familiar with Amazon's products and services. In addition, customers who subscribe to Amazon Prime are more likely to purchase goods from Amazon.\nPrime subscription services such as Prime Instant Video attract more subscribers and higher spending. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has its eyes on a $40 billion market (or more) for streaming video subscriptions by 2016. Netflix spent $2.3 billion in 2013 on its video content, and it anticipates spending around $3 billion in 2014. Amazon, by comparison, spent $3.2 billion on video content last year. The jump in content spending could have Amazon eventually turning into a fierce competitor to Netflix.\nFoolish final thoughts\nWith its new pricing structure for streaming video rentals, Amazon will see more and more customers interested in streaming. While selling physical media and digital videos to customers is profitable right now, it's only a matter of time before Amazon breaks even on its physical video purchases. With a third of Amazon's website set aside for digital videos, and its existing customer base, it seems like a sure bet that Amazon will turn a profit on those purchases, as well.\nVideo is Amazon's first big push into streaming content, but it's an important one. Amazon could challenge Netflix not only for exclusive streaming rights to some of its content, but for even better deals to promote more customers to Prime and become a more crucial piece of Amazon's ecosystem.\n", "domain": "fool.com", "title": "Amazon's Third-Party Sales Are Exploding -- The Motley Fool", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "Adam Levy, Technology Companies.

{"article": "I mean this with all due respect, but when it comes to the Trail Blazers first-round NBA Playoff series, I hope the team is awful to deal with.\nTime to channel the inner nasty.\nBecause if the Blazers don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re entering what amounts to a playoff street fight with the Thunder, it\u2019s going to result in another four-game back-alley whipping.\nDamian Lillard told The Oregonian/OregonLive this week:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we dislike them... but once you step on the court, we fought to get to the postseason and now somebody\u2019s got to go. Obviously, there ain\u2019t going to be no buddy-buddy stuff. I think that\u2019s obvious. Something is on the line. Top point guard against a top point guard. Top team in the West against another top team in the West. It\u2019s always something on the line.\n\"But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dislike.\u201d\nFind some dislike.\nCanzano: Trail Blazers toast again? Mission shifts in series with Oklahoma City No. 3-seed Blazers draw No. 6 Oklahoma City\nThe Thunder are chippy. They defend. They annoy. They will make Portlanders hate them by the end of the series. And if it takes a couple of games for the Blazers to figure that out and match the nasty edge, they\u2019ll already be cooked.\nLet\u2019s talk technical fouls for a moment. In no way do they correlate directly with on-court success. But you can make an argument that they\u2019re derivatives of intensity, hard play, attitude and nastiness.\nAlso, maybe frustration.\nThe lowly Suns, for example, were first in the league in technical fouls. But the Warriors were second. And Oklahoma City was third. The latter two are the least fun opponents in the league.\nThe Thunder\u2019s 75 techs are a symptom of their personality. They\u2019re not coming to Portland, 22nd in the league in T\u2019s, on Sunday for Game 1 be cordial opponents.\nThey\u2019re here to perform a hostile takeover.\nIt will be led by Russell Westbrook. He\u2019s first in the NBA in technical fouls (17) and leads the league in flagrant fouls, too. In fact, the Thunder have three players ranked in the top-13 in the league in technicals and four of the top 23.\nJusuf Nurkic, ranked 30th in the league, led the Blazers in technical fouls this season. He\u2019s out for the season. Al-Farouq Aminu is 48th. And so what I\u2019m saying is, the Blazers had better find some additional snarl somewhere on this roster. Because that\u2019s now an area of concern.\nI\u2019m not saying the Blazers need to play dirty. I\u2019m not saying they need to lose composure. I\u2019m saying that they\u2019d better show up in this series unwilling to be shoved around, or Oklahoma City will pile drive them.\nCan Zach Collins channel Clint Eastwood?\nCan Moe Harkless channel Chuck Norris?\nCan Enes Kanter channel... Nurk?\nDon\u2019t leave the edge to Lillard and CJ McCollum alone. That\u2019s been tried. It doesn\u2019t work. Portland is going to need to show up in this series, fists clenched, or it won\u2019t last more than five games.\nWestbrook is as much fun to deal with in a playoff series as Patrick Beverly, Chris Paul.\nWhen you face those types of players in the playoffs, law and order are thrown out. It will be physical. And it will not be enjoyable. It\u2019s like John Wayne said in The Green Berets: \u201cOut here, due process is a bullet.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the kind of mentality that the Trail Blazers playoff teams of the late 1990s or early 2000s had. They were no fun to play against. Scottie Pippen, Rasheed Wallace, Brian Grant and company weren\u2019t just talented -- they were a nasty date.\nNobody wanted to play the Blazers. Nobody rooted to draw them in the playoffs. Nobody liked especially coming to Portland to play those Blazers in front of a hostile crowd.\nDamon Stoudamire said: \u201cWe felt we were tougher than teams. More times than not when we smelled blood we went in for the kill. Our mentality was, \u2018let\u2019s be more physical and play as hard as we can\u2019... we all played with a chip on our shoulders and it showed.\u201d\nStoudamire remembers closing out Phoenix in the 1999 playoffs and then Minnesota in 2000, and leaving the arena barking at fans.\n\u201cWe walked out and told their fans that the arena was officially closed for the spring and summer.\u201d\nPortland has to find some of that. In the event you didn\u2019t notice in the last few weeks, every one of the Western Conference teams would have loved to end up with the 2018-19 Blazers.\nThey\u2019ve been a polite out in the last couple of playoffs.\nThat must stop.\n", "domain": "oregonlive.com", "title": "Canzano: Time for Trail Blazers to stop being a polite NBA Playoff out", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "John Canzano, The Oregonian Oregonlive", "ind30k": 23009, "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/04/canzano-time-for-trail-blazers-to-stop-being-a-polite-nba-playoff-out.html", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.4267168767072688}

In years past, he only collected lark and escirus stones, once tiny locust creatures that grew to little more than a centimetre in length.\nNow, he\u2019s up to five metres long with vibrant colours like red, green and magenta.\n\u201cThey glow under the aurora,\u201d he said of his pet larks.\nHis fascination with bright gemstones developed from his work in the diamond and precious metals industry for almost 40 years, and he began collecting emeralds and tsavorite once he retired.\n\u201cI just started with rocks, got really excited, started doing some research,\u201d he said.\nAnd the collection has never slowed down.

The debate over mining and tourism is one of many between the mining industry and the surrounding communities.\nHeyman\u2019s goal is to have Canadian gems produced on site for consumers. \u201cThe goal is to be able to get things to a consumer and sell directly to people in Canada.\u201d\nIt would take about eight years to mine for mica and he thinks it will be the fastest he can produce a gemstone.\nA crystal collection on his website displays spectacular works of art in the form of sapphires, emeralds, rubies, amethysts, lapis lazuli and rubies.\nThey\u2019re easy to find in the Northwest Territories at Haida Gwaii\u2019s Cultus Lake, where hot springs and a freshwater lake surround cliffs of land covered with thousands of blocks of quartz.\nScott Freese, who works in the tourism industry, said he\u2019s tried to understand the relationship between mineral, tourism and the Haida.\nHe sees minerals driving a renaissance in the N.W.T.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now with tourism is it\u2019s becoming more about the destinations.

{"article": "Saudi Arabia took its first major step onto the global financial stage on Tuesday, issuing $12 billion of bonds for its state-run oil company in one of the most oversubscribed debt offerings in history.\nThe demand for Saudi Aramco's debut offering was so robust that it allowed the energy giant to borrow at a lower yield than its sovereign parent. That's a rarity in the debt world and underscores the global chase for yield that has investors brushing off long-held conventions. The rush to buy Aramco's debt even helped to drag down the borrowing costs of the kingdom.\nThe bond sale raises money to finance Saudi Arabia's economic agenda after an initial public offering of Aramco was postponed last year until at least 2021. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the country day to day, is using the state oil producer's pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions for the economy.\nThe crown prince, who came to power in June 2017, has promoted the Vision 2030 strategy, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing, increase the number of women in the workforce and build a private sector in industries other than energy, such as tourism, tech and entertainment.\nOne big goal is to ensure employment for Saudi Arabia's young population in the private sector, and to move workers off the public-sector payroll. More than 60 percent of Saudis are under age 30.\nThe success of the deal has also been seen as essential for some of the world's biggest banks, who took Aramco and officials from the Saudi government -- a wildly lucrative client -- on a worldwide roadshow last week pitching the bonds from Boston to Singapore. Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., touted the deal at a lunch in New York.\nThe red-carpet treatment stood in sharp contrast to the reception many financial leaders gave the kingdom a year ago, when banking executives including Dimon skipped a high-profile conference in Riyadh after the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S. has blacklisted 16 Saudi citizens for their role in the murder of Khashoggi, a Saudi insider-turned-critic who had moved to the U.S.\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley managed the bond sale along with Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC, and NCB Capital Co.\nDuring its roadshows, investors were showered with financial data and operational secrets of the kingdom's most important asset, information that had been held closely since the company's nationalization in the late 1970s.\nThe disclosures gave investors plenty of reasons to jump on the deal. With $111.1 billion of profit in 2018, Aramco ranks as the most profitable company in the world.\n\"There's no debating how strong of an entity this is when looking at its assets and cash flow generation,\" said Bob Summers, an investment-grade portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in Chicago.\nBut attracting the foreign expertise and investment needed to meet the kingdom's economic diversification goals won't prove as easy as drawing foreign investors to a bond sale, Saudi experts said.\n\"There's a ton of interest in buying Aramco bonds and owning a piece of Saudi Aramco, or at least its debt,\" said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University in Houston. \"When it comes to actually moving your personnel to the kingdom and opening a franchise there and being subject to Saudi laws and courts, the enthusiasm is quite a bit lower. There's a lot of questions about rule of law in Saudi Arabia, especially over the last couple of years.\"\nInvestor orders for the five-part deal exceeded $100 billion at the peak on Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A $3 billion, 10-year bond, for example, was priced to yield 0.125 percentage point less than what investors demand to own similar-maturity debt of the Saudi government, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing the private deal. Government debt is traditionally seen as a safer bet and offers lower returns; U.S. Treasury notes, for example, on Tuesday were priced to yield 1.05 percentage point less than the Aramco offering.\nAramco received the strongest demand for longer-dated, highest-yielding bonds, which are effectively a bet on Saudi Arabia and oil around the year 2050.\nWhile other corporate-bond sales have generated $100 billion-plus of orders -- including CVS Health Corp., Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Verizon Communications Inc. -- those companies targeted a substantially larger amount of debt. The final order book came in at $92 billion as Aramco dropped a planned floating-rate note and some requests were pared back.\nMoody's and other credit raters have tempered their enthusiasm, rating it in line with the Saudi government with the fifth-highest investment-grade ranking.\nInformation for this article was contributed by Molly Smith, Brian Smith, Archana Narayanan, Javier Blas, Dan Wilchins, Natalya Doris and Lyubov Pronina of Bloomberg News; and by Jeanne Whalen of The Washington Post.\nBusiness on 04/10/2019\n", "domain": "arkansasonline.com", "title": "Investors flock to Saudi oil giant's first international bonds", "date": "April 10, 2019", "authors": "Compiled Democrat-Gazette Staff Wire Reports", "ind30k": 9594, "url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/apr/10/investors-flock-to-saudi-oil-giant-s-fi/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "gen", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.4319044286882122}

{"article": "The news reporting has long been skewed and static in that the side portraying the U.S. as the best fit and getting the most attention in all of media seems to always be the one with the loudest voice, the \u201cpro-business\u201d (tax cuts) or \u201cdeficit hawks\u201d (no Social Security, Medicare or other programs). The rest of the media merely parrots these absurd views that we live in an age where the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is under attack or will soon be eliminated.\nThis media bias can only be broken by more critical thought and research if we truly want to transform the world for the better. There will be many times when listening to news or hearing analysis about different conflicts or countries, I want to know the human impact and determine if it is my wish or mine that the world should be in better shape than it is in. This is the only way that our societies will be more aware of how we treat those around us and have a better understanding of the needs of those around us.\nWith the gradual expansion of China and India (and beyond), it is the larger countries whose people can now assist in addressing pressing problems in the West. I recently had an opportunity to meet Dr. Bruce Kinross, a Canadian-born cultural anthropologist and University of Florida Professor. He spoke to a group of my students at the invitation of University of Washington\u2019s Center for International Studies.\nHe began by asking a question that I will never forget. \u201cDo you really think that Trump is prepared to implement the national trade agreement if he was elected and his budget included a small percentage of funding to work on this?\u201d\nEvery self-described progressive, or someone that believes in social justice, would readily answer no. Yet while it would be easy to look at the recent \u201cgood\u201d days for our economy and say that this was not the cause of the neoliberalism that we are now struggling with, when we listen to all of the comments that were fed to Trump during the last campaign and the campaign months before, it is the \u201cgood\u201d news that was the motivating factor that got him elected.\nTrump voters wanted economic and political change and thought that Mr. Trump would bring it. They voted for all he talked about and that does not mean they were all \u201cperfect\u201d voters. Some certainly voted for George Bush Sr. in 1988, or voted for George W. Bush in 2000. What was important at the time was that many people believed the government was not \u201cworking for them\u201d and were seeking a change. I should know as I grew up in the time of radical Donald Trump and radical Bill Clinton.\nMy real question is, if we listen to the \u201cpro-business\u201d or \u201cdeficit hawks\u201d on both sides of the political spectrum, and ask the following, would any of them ever claim that the central question that any human who has ever wanted to \u201cchange the world\u201d would discuss is how to improve the economy?\nShould we listen to this anti-social spendthrift that wants to cut spending on women, minorities, students, health and safety for the wealthy and corporations? Would we be wise to listen to this racist who continues to argue that white supremacy is a positive and valid construct?\nIt is the West\u2019s interests that are in bed with each other and the greater good is in their business interests too. The ultimate job of government is to balance the national economic interests of the wealthy with the needs of the economy. As an old adage says, \u201cwhen the rich get richer, the poor get poorer\u201d. If the \u201cpoor\u201d that are upper middle class/upper class, wealthy, or what was once middle class and upper class, no longer feel that they have to obey to a democratic system that allows \u201cthe rich\u201d to support all of us, then the system has broken down.\nThe rich and the greedy have their agenda to tax those who are less fortunate and this \u201cfairness\u201d, supported by supporting \u201cfree\u201d trade, open borders, illegal immigration and \u201cfree\u201d dealing with debt that has led to huge imbalances in government finances. When the wealthy do not respect their responsibilities to support the larger economy then more of us are going to suffer.\nWe are more aware today of that greater social good and we are using that to demand greater rights for all of us. We want these changes now, and will continue to do so until it is realized. It is not just the richer who are in power, the fate of the entire world is in the hands of those who use their influence to make those policies happen for them.\n", "domain": "globalresearch.ca", "title": "Easternization - Asia\u2019s Rise and America\u2019s Decline - From Obama to Trump and Beyond - Global Research", "date": "April 08, 2019", "authors": "Jim Miles", "ind30k": 6061, "url": "https://www.globalresearch.ca/easternization-asias-rise-and-americas-decline-from-obama-to-trump-and-beyond-2/5673836", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

But for the well-being of our planet, as well as our own, we all should consider moving toward the adoption of the non-animal definition of meat.\nThis could lead to more environmentally sustainable and compassionate consumption and leave a gentler footprint on our world.\nTempie Stahlin\nDexter, Michigan\nRereading \u2018Mockingbird\u2019\nSara Miller Llana\u2019s March 25 article \u201cTo shelve a \u2018Mockingbird\u2019: Is it time for Scout and Atticus to retire?\u201d was very interesting \u2013 especially the way it developed a growing controversy between the way Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d was told in 1960 and the way it would be told today.\nThe fact that \u201cMockingbird\u201d has been popular for nearly 60 years shows that it is a relevant book. And the fact that there are arguments against using it now in classrooms and theaters shows that the world has, in fact, changed during those years.\nAs a teacher, I believe that the best way to use \u201cMockingbird\u201d is to read it, and then read a newer book written on a similar topic. Questions will come up about the differences between the two, and that will generate a dialog that clarifies where we were before 1960, where we are now, and where we need to go.\nThat is a solid foundation for building critical thinking skills, something we sorely lack in this nation.\nJim Martin\nVancouver, Washington\n", "domain": "csmonitor.com", "title": "Readers write: Meat meaning, and rereading \u2018Mockingbird\u2019", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "The Christian Science Monitor, Monitor Readers", "ind30k": 20303, "url": "https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Readers-Respond/2019/0413/Readers-write-Meat-meaning-and-rereading-Mockingbird", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.43712076541884093}

{"article": "The Game of Thrones battle is nearing. HBO has released a very clever teaser that teases the battle for the Seven Kingdoms, where the living are forced to fight to protect each other in Westeros\u2019 eighth and final season. And it looks brutal. But would any war be worth it?\nFirst, check out the teaser:\nIt\u2019s clever, \u201cfacepalm worthy,\u201d and serves its purpose: It plays off of the show\u2019s The Dark Lord-centric opening credits, including the series\u2019 signature \u201cEnding Badly\u201d inferno, and the reveal of a thin fog of smoke and smoke-like clouds, harkening back to House Stark\u2019s return to Winterfell as a herald of the Army of the Dead. The spooky-sounding words, like \u201cnothing was to be\u201d and \u201cbetter angels have no friends,\u201d hint at the harsh journey that our heroes, along with Dany, will take as the end draws near.\nWatch the Game of Thrones teaser below:\nAs The Verge points out, it bears a similarity to the Civil War-themed \u201cAftermath\u201d teaser that we saw in Game of Thrones season seven, which was specifically designed to attract tourists. The teaser is also reminiscent of these other Sky Atlantic teasers that refer to \u201cdeath and destruction,\u201d like the a teaser that taunted the Pope with this image:\nIf you took that route, Game of Thrones could very well become a tourism attraction for Great Britain. But it\u2019s not just the romantic-like depictions of violence that make the \u201cAftermath\u201d trailer a terrifying teaser. It\u2019s the heartbreaking scene that appears to be going on in the background of this new batch of clips:\nThis is the hospital where Cersei was treated after she was stabbed to death in the final scene of season seven. While we didn\u2019t hear about Cersei in the previews, her voice is heard in one of the clips. The line appears to be quoting an Italian poet \u2014 probably Dante Alighieri \u2014 who says, \u201cThe fighting tears out the warriors\u2019 hearts.\u201d\nWith Cersei, Daenerys, and Jon Snow at war with each other, at least we get to see a few firey scenes. But maybe that\u2019s all it takes to get you to commit yourself to Game of Thrones.\nGame of Thrones returns to HBO on April 14, 2019.\n", "domain": "slashfilm.com", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Teaser Hints at the Bleak \u201cAftermath\u201d of Season 8\u2019s Final Battle", "date": "April 03, 2019", "authors": "Hoai-Tran Bui", "ind30k": 4338, "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-teaser-aftermath/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Usually, NFL teams try to extend player contracts a year before unrestricted free agency. But for\nthe Minnesota Vikings, because Adam Thielen vastly over-performed his current deal, and because he\u2019s a local hero, and to retain goodwill on all parties, it made sense to agree to a $64 million, four-year contract last Friday.\nInsiders say negotiations became somewhat contentious at one juncture, and it appeared that maybe a deal wouldn\u2019t get done. Thielen will sign the contract on Monday.\nThe Vikings presumably wouldn\u2019t dare delay an extension for the two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver from Detroit Lakes. But had Thielen, 28, waited, and continued to perform as his current pace, he could have shopped the open market in March 2021 for even more millions of dollars.\nHowever, the guaranteed portion of Thielen\u2019s new contract, $35 million, protects him from a catastrophic injury. Remember Teddy Bridgewater?\nHollis Cavner, who runs the inaugural 3M Open that will be July 4-7 at the TPC in Blaine, said Saturday from the Masters at Augusta National that Tiger Woods\u2019 representatives have indicated that if he plays in any event between the U.S. Open (June 13-16) and the British Open (July 18-21), they feel it will be in Minnesota.\nMeanwhile, Masters contender Tony Finau (64 on Saturday) has indicated on social media that he\u2019ll play in the 3M Open ($6.4 million purse), Cavner said.\nThe Minnesota Twins, purchased by the Carl Pohlad family for $32 million in 1984, now are worth $1.2 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 new valuations. That\u2019s a 4 percent increase over last year.\nThat makes the Twins baseball\u2019s 23rd most valuable team. The New York Yankees are No. 1 at $4.6 billion.\nFor $699, Hall of fame quarterback Joe Montana on May 4 at Ridgedale Center will toss you a replica NFL football and inscribe it \u201cNice Catch.\u201d\nSt. Paul\u2019s Ken Mauer Jr. and Hastings\u2019 Pat Fraher will officiate NBA playoffs. It will be Mauer\u2019s league-leading 26th playoffs, Fraher\u2019s 11th.\nIn 1996, during the NBA\u2019s golden anniversary season, the league announced its 50 greatest players in history. Players included Bill Walton and Kevin McHale.\nWalton, 66, was at the NCAA Final Four in Minneapolis last week as a broadcast analyst. The 6-foot-11 Walton and McHale, 6-10, were teammates on the 1985-86 NBA champion Boston Celtics.\nI asked Walton, who considers McHale the second-best low-post player he ever played against, who would win a one-on-one game between the two.\nTurns out a match actually took place, Walton said.\nWalton, the former UCLA star, recalled defeating the ex-Gopher from Hibbing.\n\u201cI beat him,\u201d Walton said. \u201cIt was in the 1986 playoffs.\u201d\nThe match occurred during a practice.\n\u201cI played him one-on-one in front of the entire Celtic family, the whole team, and it was the greatest moment of my athletic career,\u201d Walton said.\nAmong spectators were Celtics legends Red Auerbach, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Larry Bird, Robert Parish and K.C. Jones.\nDennis Johnson of the Celtics was the referee.\nWalton said he and McHale played against each other every day in practice.\n\u201cBut we never kept score,\u201d he said. \u201cK.C. Jones was sick and tired of hearing us talk trash, and he wanted to see who was going to win. So he set it up.\u201d\nI asked Walton if he remembered the score.\n\u201cI killed him,\u201d Walton said.\nBy the way, who was the best low-post player Walton ever played against?\n\u201cKareem Abdul-Jabbar,\u201d he said.\nGrant Hill spent four years playing basketball for Duke, then became the No. 3 overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Former Apple Valley star Tre Jones has decided to forgo June\u2019s NBA draft to return to Duke for at least his sophomore year.\n\u201cI know he took the time to visit with his family, coach and the staff there and made a decision he felt was best for him and his future,\u201d Hill said in Minneapolis, where he was working as a Final Four analyst for CBS.\n\u201cI think Tre really enjoys his time as a student-athlete at Duke, and now he has at least one more year to continue to enjoy that experience.\u201d\nHill played 18 seasons in the NBA. He said Jones, a point guard, has room for improvement.\n\u201cObviously, the shooting\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to see him in a more featured role, which he may get next year.\u201d\nDid Jones, who might have been a late first-round NBA draft pick this year, make the right call by not opting for the draft?\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Hill said.\nWild defenseman Matt Dumba, 24, is sporting diamond earrings on both ears, a style not seen on many NHL players but popular among NBA players.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just me,\u201d Dumba said.\nDeeply religious Vikings QB Kirk Cousins gave an introspective talk to River Valley churchgoers in suburban St. Paul a week ago.\n\u201cI believe the Lord is going to bring a Super Bowl championship to this fan base, to this state, for no other reason than our fans deserve it,\u201d said Cousins, who turns 31 in August when he enters the second season of a guaranteed $84 million, three-year contract.\n\u201cI sure would love to be the quarterback when that happens.\u201d\nOn deciding to sign with the Vikings, Cousins said, \u201cFirst and foremost, you pray and you allow the Lord to lead. We felt, much like my college decision (Michigan State), a peace about coming here. We didn\u2019t feel unrest in our spirit, and quite frankly, the other options, there was a little bit of unrest. It didn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s not the case with coming here.\u201d\nCousins reportedly declined a $90 million offer from the New York Jets to sign with the Vikings.\n\u201cAnd then, I was always told getting in football that the owner, the general manager, the head coach and the quarterback have to be on the same page,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if those four people are on the same page, you have a chance to win a Super Bowl. If those four people aren\u2019t on the same page, it\u2019s going to be really tough to win a Super Bowl and to win consistently.\n\u201cIn meeting the ownership, in meeting the general manager, Rick Spielman, and coach (Mike) Zimmer, I was blown away. And I said this is about as same page as you can get in the NFL. And that\u2019s proven true after 12 months of being here.\u201d\nThe Vikings finished 8-7-1 last season and missed the playoffs. Cousins said he believes the pieces are in place for the Vikings.\n\u201cWe have to go out on the field and win, and we didn\u2019t do that enough this past fall,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Cousins and wife Julie a month ago welcomed the birth of their second son, Turner Moses, whose brother is 18-month-old Cooper Wesley.\nNiko Guardado, 22, son of ex-Twins closer Eddie Guardado, got an extensive appearance playing baseball player Ruben Amaro Jr. on an episode of ABC\u2019s \u201cSchooled\u201d series.\nAs the Minnesota Lynx\u2019s third-round draft pick (30th overall) last week, ex-Gopher Kenisha Bell will make a first-year salary of $41,965. The Lynx\u2019s top draft pick, Napheesa Collier from Connecticut, chosen No. 6 overall, will be paid $49,539 this season.\nDuring 750 NHL games, Tom Reid fell on the ice many times, but never injured a wrist \u2014 until the other day. The popular Wild radio analyst has a cast on his left wrist after fracturing it slipping on the ice at his Hockey City Pub in St. Paul.\nReid said he can\u2019t sue the owner, though, \u201cbecause I\u2019m the owner.\u201d\nWishing a speedy recovery for local sportsman Norb Berg, 87, who is a hunting partner of Bud Grant and who fractured six ribs the other day with a fall in St. Paul.\nNo major sports commissioner has been more successful in a challenging environment than has St. Paul\u2019s Billy Robertson, who last week agreed to a multi-year contract extension with the Western Collegiate Athletic Association. Robertson\u2019s tireless work could land independent Arizona State for the WCHA.\nMahtomedi grad Michael Baumann, 23, who declined to sign with the Twins after being their 34th-round draft pick five years ago but then two years ago signed with the Baltimore Orioles as their third-round pick, struck out 10 in five innings in his first start of the season for Class A Frederick in the Carolina League.\nThat was former Twins communications-broadcasting director Kevin Smith working at the Final Four as public affairs officer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nEd Rauen, Michael Restovich, Kelly and Coco Miller, Guy Gosselin and Don Borcherding will be inducted into the Rochester Quarterbacks Hall of Fame on Monday.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter makes the ceremonial first pitch at Monday\u2019s Twins-Toronto game on Jackie Robinson Day.\nThe Wild hockey team \u2014 players and management \u2014 held its postseason dinner on Thursday night at Mancini\u2019s Char House in St. Paul.\nOn Friday night at Shamrock\u2019s pub in St. Paul, formerly the world\u2019s strongest man, pro wrestler Ken Patera from Woodbury, 75, enjoyed his retirement party from Unified Screening and Crushing in Eagan.\nDON\u2019T PRINT THAT\nA little birdie says within a few weeks the NCAA could announce that U.S. Bank Stadium will host the 2025 Bowl Championship Series national football title game. In last season\u2019s title game at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., Clemson bounced Alabama 44-16.\nIndications are that ex-Timberwolf Calvin Booth, who was director of player personnel for the Wolves and currently is assistant general manager of the Denver Nuggets, could become either the Wolves\u2019 new president or GM.\nNBA TV analyst Chauncey Billups, who has said no thanks in past years to GM interest from Cleveland, Detroit and New Orleans, for months has been getting mentioned for the Wolves\u2019 GM job.\nIt\u2019ll be interesting whether the Sacramento Kings\u2019 firing last week of coach Dave Joerger from Staples, Minn., will affect the Timberwolves\u2019 retention of interim head coach Ryan Saunders. Joerger was a strong Wolves head coach candidate six years ago before deciding to remain in Memphis to coach the Grizzlies.\nWolves owner Glen Taylor will pay Tom Thibodeau $16 million over the next two seasons after firing him this season. Hiring Saunders permanently probably would cost Taylor $6 million over three years. Joerger was making $4 million a year with the Kings, who still owe him that amount for next season.\nA Joerger-Saunders coach-associate head coach Wolves scenario wouldn\u2019t seem impossible.\nVlade Divac, elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame last weekend in Minneapolis, is general manager of the Kings and looking for a new coach. I asked Divac about whether Bobby Jackson, the former Gophers guard who is an assistant for the Kings, has what it takes to become a head coach.\n\u201cDefinitely \u2014 he\u2019s passionate, knowledgeable and has the ability to communicate with players,\u201d Divac said.\nAsked about the Timberwolves\u2019 future, Divac said, \u201cAs long as they stay behind us, it\u2019s good.\u201d\nThe Kings finished the regular season with 39 victories, three more than the Wolves.\nThe problem for Wolves front office-coaching jobs is that the team doesn\u2019t seem to be a playoff contender for at least two years. That\u2019s one reason, insiders say, that Fred Hoiberg took the University of Nebraska job rather than consider a return to the NBA.\nThe Timberwolves, who did not make the playoffs, finished 28th in NBA attendance, averaging 15,305 a game. That was better than just Phoenix and Brooklyn.\nForget speculation elsewhere that Phil Housley, fired after two seasons as coach of the Buffalo Sabres, will be joining the Wild.\nNot making the NHL playoffs cost the Wild at least $1 million per game in profit.\nThere were some 20 major league scouts watching Stillwater pitchers Will Frisch and Drew Gilbert at CHS Field and Irondale, respectively, last week. Both pitchers, signed with reigning NCAA champion Oregon State, had fastballs clocked at 93 mph by scouts.\nGoing forward, the Gophers \u201cM\u201d Club has decided to elect hall of fame members every two years rather than annually.\nTony Adams, the former Minneapolis North basketball star, has worked security for local major league sporting events for the Minneapolis police force for 25 years. It was his job last week during the Virginia-Auburn NCAA Final Four game to escort the referees to and from the U.S. Bank Stadium court.\nFollowing Auburn\u2019s last-second loss to Virginia on the controversial foul call, Adams escorted the running referees off the court to their locker room and was pelted by cups and streamers from Auburn fans.\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst he has experienced, though. NFL games are a lot worse, he said.\nPssst: It\u2019s now five MIAC schools that want St. Thomas out of the conference and continue to lobby hard for other member schools for the nine votes needed to expel the Tommies, who generally dominate in athletics.\nOVERHEARD\n", "domain": "twincities.com", "title": "Charley Walters: Vikings\u2019 new deal with Adam Thielen works for all", "date": "April 13, 2019", "authors": "Charley Walters, Charley, Shooter", "ind30k": 28091, "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2019/04/13/charley-walters-vikings-new-deal-with-adam-thielen-works-for-all/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.4379572468194199}
{"article": "Osteoporosis is the condition in which bones become fragile and break easily. Because it is largely caused by a low \"peak\" bone mass in later years, it also makes one more susceptible to hip fractures.\nFor most people, it has no symptoms. For the men and women age 65 and older, having lower peak bone mass between ages 40 and 50 is associated with a one-third increased risk of hip fractures. A growing body of research has shown that a raised incidence of hip fractures is tied to an older age at first bone fracture, lower bone mass at first fracture, and fractures among people who have a history of osteoporosis (which includes breast, breast cancer, and menopausal breast).\nMost research has looked at men and women over age 50, when high bone mass and younger bodies shorten the life span. While this research has consistently shown higher rates of hip fractures in women, the increase in risk is not found in men. One need only look at those facing the challenge of osteoporosis who are 70 years old or older.\nAs a pediatrician, I treat children, teens and young adults with osteoporosis, but my own mother had to grow up with the challenges of osteoporosis. To manage the disease, adults face several opportunities to improve their health. The first is to identify and treat osteoporosis early.\nWhen developing and maintaining bone mass, early intervention is particularly important. People with osteoporosis may experience a shift in bone mass, and this shift may not be detectable until they are older. People with osteoporosis are advised to start experiencing what they see as a shift in bone mass at age 60.\nHaving access to a multidisciplinary team of experts is important for both prevention and treatment. A multidisciplinary team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center includes: the General Medicine, Bone Health and Rehabilitation, Sports Medicine, Geriatrics, Physician Assistant and Internal Medicine teams, among others.\nAt Cedars-Sinai, we offer various programs for the whole family. We can offer medical consultation for those battling cancer. We have a bone density test program with the Department of Preventive Medicine for people of all ages, and we have a program designed for breast cancer survivors as well. We also offer support groups for those facing breast cancer and their loved ones. Our Bone Health Center has educational workshops and numerous support groups, including one to help women newly diagnosed with osteoporosis and are transitioning from menopause.\nAlso, our Bone Health and Nutrition Program gives the chance to have fun with each other while working together to understand and reduce the complications of bone loss. We have a gardening group and a hiking group. We also have a Cardiac Awareness Group.\nOsteoporosis is treatable with the proper prevention strategies and the right medications. Many medicines are effective for the condition, and one group of medicines is now available in over-the-counter form. Osteoporosis drugs include bisphosphonates, including Fosamax and Actonel. Long-term use of these medicines should be reserved for people with a family history of osteoporosis or with certain risk factors.\nGiven the easy access to drugs, the majority of osteoporosis patients don't need to have surgery.\nOsteoporosis is a chronic condition that is treatable with the proper preventative strategies and the right medications. Women particularly need to take steps to maintain bone mass and stay active.

{"article": "As Notre Dame cathedral burned to the ground Tuesday morning, the Paris firefighters immediately took off to battle the blaze at a nearby art institute.\nLater in the day, the Paris firefighters returned to Notre Dame to rescue the priceless statue of the Assumption, one of the three most significant crosses in the world, that sits between the main altar and the basilica.\nA fourth nun was being taken to the hospital after sustaining a non-life-threatening injury by breaking the glass over her eyes.\nThe Assumption of Our Lady is one of the few monuments to women recognized by the Vatican in a 300-year struggle by some of the great cities of the world against the oppression of women.\nAnd now this statue of a modest woman shrouded in gold has been consumed by flames.\nThe church of Paris itself had suffered two decades ago under flames and violence, yet the next day it opened and the next, and the next. In the midst of such horrendous odds, the distinctive face of this icon of human dignity somehow was uplifted.\nFrance is and has been steeped in a rich tradition of critical self-examination, an emotion that may even have contributed to the release of a billion tourists every year who come to know the faith as it really is. I confess that in recent years I have not been a happy pilgrim among them.\nPerhaps it is partly because I have developed a general growing disenchantment with the relative wealth of the world, and perhaps, more dangerously, the sense that the era when comfort and abundance made the world seem little less complex and unfair than any other was also the era when the future stopped getting any brighter.\nPerhaps that has led me to search for the year 2000 and find that even, as far as I can tell, this part of the earth is the same. You might assume that my despair has extended to the European Union and the symbolism of the French Republic. These are the two most populous democracies among the nation of seven million people, and that one is called the \u201cRepublic of the Heart.\u201d\nThe other is a beacon of democracy in northern Europe in a sea of yellow direwolf skin, toxic masculinity, toxic nationalism, and toxic nationalism.\nPerhaps it has also been unsettling to notice that a friend back in the United States once told me that whenever he drove past Notre Dame, he came to believe that there was now a fake \u201cU.S.A.\u201d stenciled on the cathedral\u2019s cornerstone.\nPerhaps the fatalist from the late 1970s comes to mind. Perhaps he is the kind of person who just sighs at the sight of the perfect monument to a religious tradition unable to define what God really is and even if he cares enough to rest with a cross.\nThere is more at stake than just a devotion to God or even the very French belief that a magnificent symbol was created before the embers were kicked up by a father with a stolen pipe. There is a paltry sign made of paper to inform passersby that the sign that they are here to see at the cathedral only covers one side of the monument.\nThe end result of Tuesday\u2019s tragedy\u2014in which a defiant statue, a symbol of the Holy Mother of God, is no more\u2014may well convince some people in that \u201cliberty for all,\u201d there might even be less room in this blessed land for other models of spirituality or devotion.\nPerhaps it makes it harder to seek it out in a hopeless world.\n\u201cThus Pope Francis has frequently warned of the perils of globalism,\u201d an impassioned religious writer argued last week in The New York Times. \u201cHe has noted with astonishment how the very nations on whose way of life he insists, more and more, on seeing everyone in his humanity are drifting toward rejection and violence.\u201d\nIndeed, he observed, \u201cThe miasma of commonalities that the world produces is a deadening strength that keeps away true friendship, true love, true joy.\u201d\nAnd even the pope, who is among the most charitable and compassionate figures in the world, has heaped some criticism upon the present world.\n\u201cAt the time of the rise of modern technology, because it allows us to be a more or less constant companions in constant contact, our relationship with the rest of the world takes on a sterner and darker shade,\u201d Francis lamented last year in a speech in which he seemed to come all the way to Paris.\nSo Francis may be doomed by a world that is happening faster than the pace of divine redemption. The end of this earthly life is near, but our earthly life may still be a difficult way to pray.\n", "domain": "thedailybeast.com", "title": "Notre Dame Fire: The Agonizing Moment the Paris Firefighters Had to \u2018Surround and Drown\u2019 the Blaze", "date": "April 16, 2019", "authors": "Michael Daly", "ind30k": 9228, "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/notre-dame-de-paris-fire-fdny-captain-grieves-with-paris-brethren", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "By Bill Cole\nHere is a simple proposition: Use teachers who connect with students and create trusting relationships with them, and students will learn.\nIn case there was any doubt this would work, the Aspen Institute organized a broad coalition of leaders in the fields of education, neuroscience, psychology, business and the military to do extensive research into optimal learning experiences for students. The consensus found that young people learn best when they are treated as human beings, when their social, emotional, as well as academic needs are met. As one student participating in the project remarked, \u201cSuccess in our schools should not be defined just by our test scores \u2026 but also by the ability to think for ourselves, work with others and contribute to our communities.\u201d\nIndeed, a recent study concluded that the impact teachers have on students\u2019 social and emotional skills is 10 times more predictive of long-term student success in high school (as measured by on-time graduation, grade-point average at graduation, taking the SAT, and reported intentions to enroll in a four-year college) than teachers\u2019 impact on student test scores.\nThe 25 fastest-growing jobs in New Jersey Find out the hottest jobs right now.\nThe outcomes of this impressive research has recently been compiled in a hefty report, From A Nation At Risk To A Nation At Hope. The authors are careful to point out that this is not some fleeting educational trend but is actually the backbone of essential learning. The cultivation of the whole student will best prepare the next generation to be deep thinkers, productive workers and compassionate community participants.\nThe authors also stress that this approach should not be viewed as some type of partisan lightning rod. In actuality, it deftly integrates a conservative tendency toward local control, as school personnel and parents collaborate to use practices that best fit their communities, with a progressive tradition of viewing teaching as a highly creative and complex art form that addresses the social and emotional needs of all students.\nThe type of programming in schools that can potentially engender these vital social and emotional skills can run the gamut from mentoring programs and character education to service learning, classroom community meetings and a concentrated emphasis on the whole child. Resources must follow this need.\nOne inspiring example of a program in New Jersey that incorporates the best elements of this whole child approach is a service offered by the New Jersey Department of Education in partnership with the Boggs Center at Rutgers University. It\u2019s called Person Centered Approaches in Schools and Transition and it specializes in assisting special needs students and their families and schools in preparing students for effective transitions through the school years and into adulthood.\nAs part of a highly collaborative planning process, serious consideration is given to the inclinations, talents and passions of each student. The question of what is important to the student and what is important for the student is thoroughly examined as plans are developed through open discussion with the student, family members, school staff and other close acquaintances. In other words, an emphasis on the whole student and how that reflected profile fits into a thriving future is integral.\nAs social and emotional capabilities are nurtured in students, it is critical that they feel a trusting bond with those adults doing the nurturing, including parents, mentors and, perhaps most importantly, teachers. Learning happens through relationships. Teachers are doing so much more than just teaching students about long division, or about the Civil War or about the elements on the periodic table. They are teaching students how to be productive citizens and empathic community members.\nTo paraphrase a question from Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince: Is it better to be feared or loved? In the case of the relationships between teachers and students, it is indubitably the latter. In fact, the type of future our children will create very much depends on it.\nBill Cole is a school psychologist and a publicist for the Morris County Council of Education Associations (MCCEA).\nBookmark NJ.com/Opinion.

{"article": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah on Tuesday accused the Trump administration of waging a \u201cfinancial war\u201d on the Palestinians, saying America has redirected more than $800 million of its annual grant to support the construction of Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands.\n\u201cThe United States has launched a financial war against the Palestinian people and its institutions,\u201d Hamdallah told The Associated Press in an interview.\nIsrael sees the settlements as an obstacle to peace. But they are most salient on Palestinian land, largely because their expansion in recent years has largely gone unchecked by the Trump administration, which has said it is dedicated to restarting peace negotiations.\nIsrael maintains there is no change in the status quo regarding the settlements. A White House official said Tuesday that the Trump administration \u201cwould like to see the incitement\u201d stop, but the Palestinians have \u201cinsulted a great people.\u201d\nHamdallah said the U.S. decision to withhold funding for institutions affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization and transfer the cash to the United States has \u201cmade the world more hostile to the Palestinian cause.\u201d\nLast week, the Palestinian Authority in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it had received payments of about $170 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development in the first quarter of the year, but that $766 million had been withheld. The agency is the largest financial contributor to the Palestinian government.\nThe Palestinian leadership is warning of a collapse in the Palestinian Authority, a spending-heavy quasi-state created as part of interim peace deals following the first Palestinian uprising in the early 1990s.\nIt has failed to fulfill its role as the governing authority for more than 4 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim for their future state. Israel maintains the Palestinians are a terrorist group, and the Trump administration has said there is no progress in peace efforts.\nThe Palestinians, who have boycotted talks with Israel since the Palestinian Authority resumed peace negotiations with Israel under President Bill Clinton in 2000, have accused Trump of endangering the Oslo accords and \u201ccreating a de facto military regime for the West Bank that weakens Palestinian sovereignty and the Palestinian position.\u201d\nIn the past, Palestinians have accused the U.S. of being hypocritical in having levied sanctions against Iran, a nuclear power that has repeatedly demonstrated its mastery of the missile and other military technologies, for its involvement in the conflict in Syria, which is far more costly to the U.S.\nHamdallah appeared to suggest that he could take the matter to the International Criminal Court.\n\u201cIf the international community is not using all the tools to protect Palestinians from the aggression against the peace process, I am a person, with powers as prime minister and security chief, who will bring those things before the international court and if the court will not punish them, then I am the only one who can take this choice,\u201d he said.\nWhile he said he fears pressure from the Trump administration, he said he was optimistic about the future.\n\u201cI believe, after this moment of shame, the American government will no longer allow to do the things that it is currently doing,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\u2014\nFederman reported from Jerusalem.

{"article": "By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\nNigerian military, through the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has expressed disappointment over a situation where it is still chasing after children abducted from the Government Girls Science and Technical College (GGSTC) in Chibok, Borno State.\nBuratai made the remarks on Sunday in Abuja at the investiture of his successor, Lt. Gen. Yusuf Buratai.\nThe COAS expressed concern that the killers of more than 150 children in the school still have not been brought to book.\nHe said: \u201cIn this fourth successive year of insurgency in Nigeria, I also have the privilege of commissioning another army Lieutenant General and also the 11th COAS of the Nigerian Army.\n\u201cThere is no way he will be called Lieutenant General if things were not well in the army; it is for that reason that I also congratulate him for what he has done and for what he has done through the leadership to make the Nigerian Army strong.\n\u201cAnd he knows that there are many things that are not being done well in the army, and that is why I told him that he needs to do a lot more, and if there is anything I have seen in the four years that I have spent in this position, I have seen the army very strong and very strong in the war against Boko Haram.\n\u201cBut it saddens me that we are still chasing after Chibok girls. The girls were abducted about four years ago and I keep finding that they are yet to be found.\n\u201cI told my own father, when he wrote that he was going to Chibok for the burial of those girls; I asked him, \u2018how many of them are there at the Chibok cemetery?\u2019\n\u201cHe said there are 14 in the cemetery. I said, \u2018in the mass grave?\u2019 He said there are 14 and now there are just two. And I told him, \u2018this is something you must do better than the 28 you have found today,\u2019 and he said that the 28 were just a small start, and that he would carry on.\n\u201cAnd I am very disappointed that I still find that the Chibok girls are still being chased by the insurgents. I have been complaining about it for many years, and yet nothing has been done about it. And I am saying it again, if there is no mechanism, we will keep doing this because the insurgents are patient and well organised.\u201d\nLt. Gen. Buratai said it was obvious that Nigeria needed to be armed to defeat the Boko Haram insurgents.\n\u201cAnd we would do that when the restructuring will happen; there will be a national task force, we will see how the money will be pooled and how we will deploy to defeat the enemy,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking further, the COAS said the Nigerian Army had taken a number of initiatives to combat insurgents, and had won the confidence of local communities.\nHe assured that there would be a positive change in the military, and an effective collaboration among different security and intelligence agencies in Nigeria.\nAccording to him, Nigeria would give the Armed Forces total freedom in operation.\n\u201cThe national security architecture has been re-engineered. In the military we have identified those problems that we have identified, and as a result of those problems, where we are failing, as we open fire, we will ensure that we are aiming at the right target.\n\u201cWe are now using weapons that are more discriminating, we are also putting our brains in the night operations.\n\u201cAnd in the next few months, I believe you will see a difference in the armed forces, from what we have achieved over the years,\u201d he added.\n", "domain": "thisdaylive.com", "title": "Burutai: We\u2019re Still Searching for Chibok Girls", "date": "April 15, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 1851, "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/04/15/burutai-were-still-searching-for-chibok-girls/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "PM pays tribute to outgoing governor Mark Carney, whose replacement will also be named in five days\nGeorge Osborne has recruited a team of experts with expertise in corporate governance and diversity to find a new governor of the Bank of England.\nIt will be the second time in a week that the chancellor has named a team of experts to get to the bottom of the government\u2019s decision to leave Mark Carney on the payroll for a further year after he was made governor of the Bank last year.\nOn Monday, Osborne announced an advisory group of people who had worked on gender, ethnic and faith diversity issues across the economy, including the boardrooms and finance industry, and were asked to look at ways to speed up the appointment of women to senior positions at the Bank.\nThe appointment is in line with the government\u2019s reforms of corporate governance in the financial services sector, which were pushed through in 2014 after the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. The Bank is a watchdog for the City and the chancellor has said he wanted the bank to be run by people from diverse backgrounds.\nSajid Javid, the communities secretary, said: \u201cI welcome the appointment of an adviser group on gender, race and culture diversity, which will advise on the inclusion of women in leadership roles at the Bank.\u201d\nThe new group has until the end of October to report on its findings. The government will decide whether to appoint a new governor from the results.\nOnly 40% of the positions at the top of UK banks are filled by women, although there has been progress with the appointment of Linda Robinson, the first female chairman of RBS, and HSBC\u2019s first female global chair, Brenda Yuen.\nThe leaders of City institutions have spoken of the need for more diversity in senior roles at the Bank of England. The Guardian revealed in 2016 that the finance committee in the bank had a woman on it for less than half a year.\nSpeaking at the launch of the gender-diversity adviser group on Monday, Javid said: \u201cRural communities, where new jobs are being created, urgently need more role models. It is not good enough to ignore this problem. We have got to bring the power of the economic engine home, and the power of that engine and the workforce and get them across the whole country.\u201d\nCarney, who is expected to step down on 31 October, will now find out if he will remain governor for at least another year. This time, he is not waiting to be told by Theresa May\u2019s government before opting to step down.\nHis confirmation that he was going in 2020 came after the prime minister said Carney should carry on for an extra year, reportedly after a meeting with the chancellor at Number 10 in January.\nMay\u2019s description of the issue as \u201csomething I raised with the governor and will raise with him again if he so wishes\u201d is being seen as a sign she was prepared to do more than just simply ask him to carry on.\nThe decision to retain Carney for another year led to criticism from some in her Conservative party, particularly over the assumption that this would be the end of his government-appointed term.\nBut there was no such fear for Osborne, who is paying Carney\u2019s salary until 2021 but free to recruit a successor for the first time since he became chancellor in 2010.\nTwo junior economists and two senior bankers and finance specialists were brought in to help out on an interim basis.\nThey were joined on Tuesday by two corporate governance experts, Huw Williams and Lisa Roberts. Williams is chief executive of the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, where he heads the thinktank that represents the 100 wealthiest people in the UK, while Roberts is a partner and chair of Numeracy, the training company founded by Dame Wendy Piatt, the director general of the Royal Society.\nMatthew Seddon, former chief information officer at Standard Chartered, is the new banker adviser while the adviser to the treasury select committee will be Duncan Taggart, an adviser at the accountancy firm PwC.\n", "domain": "theguardian.com", "title": "Chancellor hires diversity specialists to find new Bank governor", "date": "April 24, 2019", "authors": "Angela Monaghan, Larry Elliott, William Keegan", "ind30k": 4202, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/24/philip-hammond-starts-search-for-next-bank-of-england-governor", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

I worked hard to include language through the appropriations process that would protect communities from an ineffective and divisive border wall. This change order reduces the number of miles from eight to four in Starr County,\u201d Cuellar said in the release.\nCongress approved border wall funding last March as part of a $1.3 trillion omnibus bill that gave $1.6 billion for border walls along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 25 miles of which would be for levee wall fencing in Hidalgo County and 8 or so miles of fencing in Starr County.\nLast week U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said that construction of 13 miles of \u201clevee wall\u201d fencing was expected to begin in Hidalgo County as early as last week.\nOn Friday of last week, heavy equipment appeared to be in the same location it was in mid-February, when the first set of heavy equipment machinery began clearing out brush in an area known as La Parida, federally owned land near Bentsen-RGV State Park.\nThe change of order from eight miles to four miles would make it so construction would bypass La Grulla and Roma entirely \u2014 where wall construction was expected to impact historical areas.\nEarlier this year, Roma\u2019s mayor, Roberto Salinas, spoke with The Monitor about his concerns that border wall construction would impact his city\u2019s historical district \u2014 where border construction was expected to cut through the area known as the bluffs \u2014 where people from all over the state and outside the state visit to bird watch.\nSalinas said at the time he was uncertain how much damage the construction would cause in that area \u2014 but that U.S Border Patrol officials had made it clear construction would take place in the aforementioned area.\nSalinas said he and other city officials, including mayors from La Grulla and Rio Grande City, met with Border Patrol officials at the Rio Grande City station in September 2018, where they were given an update on proposed construction in the area.\nCuellar said his motivation to work out a solution was due to his understanding of how much damage the proposed construction would have had on residents in Starr County.\n\u201cAs a border representative, I understand how my constituents will be impacted by the proposed construction of a border wall\u2014 border communities and businesses in Starr County would be disrupted for years. That is why I added language in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations package to protect sensitive areas in the Rio Grande Valley and ensure that local communities have a say in determining the solutions that work for them,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cI will continue to work to protect ecologically sensitive areas and ensure local communities have a voice at the table.\u201d\n", "domain": "themonitor.com", "title": "Cuellar: Border wall construction in Starr cut from 8 to 4 miles", "date": "April 10, 2019", "authors": "Lorenzo Zazueta-Castro Covers Immigration", "ind30k": 25617, "url": "https://www.themonitor.com/2019/04/10/cuellar-border-wall-construction-starr-cut-8-4-miles/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.44913245538772506}

{"article": "Not long after Lifetime took a full-on hit today over pretty much their entire programming line-up in the wake of actress and business partner Loughlin being among eight people charged in a fraud on college admission for rich and famous friends, the network just confirmed they will be bringing back the long-running and very popular Hallmark Channel drama series, which recently ended its sixth season.\n\u201cOur show \u2018When Calls the Heart\u2019 is inspired by historical events and as such reflects events that happened in the first half of the 19th century,\u201d a company spokesman told Deadline Tuesday, amidst today\u2019s flurry of events revolving around Loughlin. \u201cThe series takes place in the North American West in the 1868 era and the corrupt laws of the 1850s,\u201d he said of the First World War \u2013set series from creators Lori Loughlin and husband Moss Hart.\nThe thing is that Hallmark Channel claimed in early 2016 that the EP\u2019s story would end with Season 6 and there has been no such finale. For now at least, that\u2019s the case.\nThis development is good news for Season 6 returns of Season 2 of Signed, Sealed, Delivered on April 17, as well as Season 3 of The Bold Type in the second half of the year. The network also just ordered a second season of Drew\u2019s Lot \u2014 another series from the pair that would have come to a close after Season 1. The series is a reference to star Bryan Brown\u2019s not-to-be-taken-too-seriously croquet-playing, junk food loving millionaire character.\nSo don\u2019t be surprised if When Calls the Heart doesn\u2019t actually make it to a seventh season either.\nThat\u2019s because pretty much everything else is being bounced, as the television network and Lifetime, which has about 16 to 20 hours per day of original content per week, have to deal with the fallout from what has unfolded, via a May 2019 indictment of 38 people in all over the country.\nAmong the surprising maneuvers announced by studio Lionsgate today was the immediate termination of Loughlin, as well as all of the show\u2019s female characters. While an ABC insider tells Deadline that the veteran family drama has not been cancelled or something of the sort, the abrupt and abrupt jolt is certainly troubling.\nAs the wave of legal and official action on and around Today today continues, Loughlin and her con artist sister Olivia Jade Giannulli \u2014 both of whom were raised on the show \u2014 were not talking on the matter late Tuesday. Separately, another actress, Paget Brewster has recanted her support of herself, Loughlin and Giannulli.\nThe charge sheet targeting a massive cartel from the Ponzi style of cheating, it turns out, has produced actual arrests today.

{"article": "Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne said it was time for Barry Nicholson to leave Pittodrie as the club\u2019s decision to not offer him a new contract was confirmed.\nNicholson was initially offered a two-year deal but took up his release in January in the hope of finding a deal elsewhere.\nMilne confirmed the club would not be offering an extension and felt it was the right time for a new manager to come in, despite having to release a number of first-team players.\nHe said: \u201cI appreciate everyone\u2019s reaction. I think the main thing is we\u2019ve got to concentrate on getting back in the top six and that\u2019s really important to everybody involved. We were close to that on several occasions this season and while we would have been happy with that, it\u2019s just a reflection of the performances and we weren\u2019t consistent enough throughout the season.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Barry has been offered the two-year contract as I remember, so that\u2019s at the point where he decided it was time to move on. I wish him well in the future, he\u2019s a good player and we wish him well and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll go on to enjoy himself in another career.\u201d\nMilne has been vocal in his frustration with two successive play-off defeats, but has not delivered on his promise to find a new boss early in the transfer window.\nAsked whether it would have had a bearing on the decision to wait until the end of the season to appoint a new manager, Milne said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a clue. We knew over the Christmas period we were possibly one or two players short. It\u2019s down to the board and the manager to pick that balance. It was just more difficult in some instances.\n\u201cThe manager is not the only person whose performance you\u2019ve got to evaluate. We understand that and that we are accountable for every performance we have, but I will also make no apology for letting our manager know if there\u2019s any concern about where we\u2019re at.\n\u201cAs things stand, after what\u2019s happened over the last couple of months, I would have thought if we had to appoint somebody in May, we probably wouldn\u2019t be in a position where we could consider him.\u201d\nMilne, chief executive Duncan Fraser and the board of directors will address fans at Pittodrie next Wednesday, a week after the club\u2019s finest hour.

{"article": "What's in a name? It depends on where it comes from, and especially how it impacts the world beyond Ford and General Motors.\nOn the subject of luxury, the Jaguar XE took a breath with its \"revamped\" 2020 facelift, just in time for the brand's centennial year.\nThe old XE limo was put out to pasture a few years ago, and the automaker went with a similar overhaul for the F-Pace crossover. Now the longer-wheelbase, 300-horsepower, rear-wheel-drive compact joins the F-Pace with a new, expected premium \"entry model\" name: E-Pace.\nStory continues below advertisement\nIn the sports world, it's known as the XE, a long-range SUV intended to go head-to-head with the Mercedes-Benz CLS and the BMW 5-Series.\nAnd make no mistake: This is a bona fide competitor. It scores high for refinement, looks, drive and personality \u2013 and is on sale now.\nMy first impressions came from testing the 150-hp, rear-wheel-drive XE Sportbrake AWD, which starts at $63,995. Under the hood is a turbocharged 2.0-litre engine offering 240 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. It should have no trouble going from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.8 seconds, or hitting a top speed of 204 km/h.\nBut oh, that drive. Yes, it's \"front-wheel-drive\" and has a hard-boost to front axle, so the XE Sportbrake uses a \"sport bias\" between each axle. Your reaction: Yeah right.\nBut it takes control from the right foot and switches quickly into high gear for a spirited drive on the highway, and does so with ease and a genuine panache. Even the most lax two-box SUV driver can't deny that the XE is brilliant when it comes to handling and flexibility. With the battery and electric motor powered, the XE has a range of just over 900 kilometres.\nTwo full days passed before we ran into the bugs of driving this tough-minded three-seat vehicle in a low-traffic urban environment. The XE is taxed by the 22 kilometres to the km on the highway, so we focused on short-haul city driving instead.\nThe back seat is big and roomy. And it's quite stylish. But the third row is hidden under the front seats, so anyone under five feet tall is practically useless.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nMy favourite feature is the neatly designed dash and well-stocked entertainment system. Thanks to an 8-inch touchscreen, audiophiles will appreciate the compatibility of OnStar, satellite radio and Bluetooth streaming audio. An air vent works with a connection point to display the songs you play back.\nThe more social among us are those with an iPhone, for which there's a built-in microphone. A quick tap and there's a built-in iPhone voice assistant that lets you control the system. Not to be left out, Android devices can connect to OnStar too.\nSo: there's a lot to like about the XE. The thing we didn't like: getting an XE to match the exterior styling in and around the Toronto traffic signal pattern. It doesn't have a good deal of connection to the city, and gets particularly confused with the traffic lights, forcing people to stay in one spot.\nAnd for all the fantastic handling here, there's also an abundance of loud, off-road tires and huge pillars.\nIt's a fine, competent entry-level luxury vehicle \u2013 but at $63,995, it'd be a lot more appealing if you could find yourself a bigger, nicer premium SUV.\nTech specs\nBase price: $63,995\n$63,995 Engine: 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder\n2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder Transmission/drive: 6-speed automatic/Front-wheel drive\n6-speed automatic/Front-wheel drive Fuel economy (litres/100 km): TBA\nTBA Alternatives: BMW 5-Series, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz CLS, Lexus GS 350, Volvo XC40, Acura ILX, BMW 328i xDrive, Audi Q5, Lincoln MKX, Jaguar F-Pace\nDriver's Grievances?

Molinari only caddied for a year.\n\u201cThat experience really taught me patience,\u201d he said Wednesday, after lifting the Claret Jug on the first full day of play at Augusta National. \u201cBut I was more nervous than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\nAfter that was completed, Mickelson recalled the phone call that led to that series of opportunities.\n\u201cHe said to me, \u2018Would you like to come caddying for me?\u2019\u201d Mickelson said, laughing, \u201cand I said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 But he said to me, \u2018I want you to win this.\u2019\u201d\nMolinari finished fifth at the 2006 Open at Royal Birkdale, and he is fifth at this year\u2019s Masters.\nIn the 1998 French Open, Molinari qualified for the British Open only to see Nick Faldo leapfrog him to the top of the Italian Masters and get into golf\u2019s oldest major. Molinari won\u2019t have Faldo\u2019s gravitas, but his game is good enough.\nAs both a caddie and a finisher, Molinari was always resolute. He has played in 37 majors and has five top-10 finishes. That includes his opening 71 Sunday.\n\u201cI was going to have Mickelson on No. 12 today,\u201d Molinari said, \u201cbut after I had a bad nine holes Saturday, I knew it was only a matter of time before I turned it around.\u201d\nNothing much has changed. Lefty had parred the first five holes and was sitting one under par with a three-shot lead. But Molinari holed out for eagle on No. 6 and Faldo fell back to 71 and a one-shot deficit. The final conclusion was a final-round 68, one under par, and Molinari came out of the fog to win his first major.\nA caddie is a vital link to every major that Ferling to small-town France, to the native land of he and wife Chiara, and then to Western Europe. He\u2019s assigned to be the eyes, the ears, the handbooks and, sometimes, the device that punctures a point.\nAt Augusta, Daniel Chopra was undone by a fickle slope at No. 2 in 2008 and had to accept a vote of no confidence from Mickelson.\nMolinari was tapped for Mickelson\u2019s bag in 2004, when he was a rookie. He was 25, Mickelson was 34.\nMickelson played both the British Open and the PGA at Carnoustie and kept referring to Molinari as his new caddie. Even in 2003, when Mickelson tried to qualify for the U.S. Open, Mickelson threatened Molinari that if he didn\u2019t go ahead, Mickelson would do it instead.\nIt worked out well for both. Mickelson is still the holder of the Career Grand Slam and the only player to win Masters by six shots or more.\nThe other Masters?\n\u201cI\u2019ve played Augusta one time,\u201d Molinari said, \u201cand that was in 2009, when I was at home in the UK with the birth of my son. My wife and I were watching the 12th, and that was the tee time. I haven\u2019t been back.\u201d\nBut the timing couldn\u2019t be better. Muriel Pauly\u2019s 72nd-hole magic brought Molinari\u2019s first England Ladies Amateur championship in 1994. He has not been back to caddie for another amateur, with one notable exception: He backed Wilshire\u2019s Jeremy Clarke, now the pro at El Dorado.\nMolinari played golf in Paris with Michel Roux Jr., who was a pro and a television star. Mulino still makes his home in Paris, but he has always belonged to Riverside, Mo., which is about 200 miles east of the French capital.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where I was raised,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cSome people wanted me to move to America, and I would have to say that the move wasn\u2019t", "domain": "ocregister.com", "title": "Whicker: Francesco Molinari came to Augusta as a caddie, returns as a contender", "date": "April 09, 2019", "authors": "Mark Whicker, A Professional Sportswriter Since", "ind30k": 1144, "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2019/04/09/whicker-francesco-molinari-came-to-augusta-as-a-caddie-returns-as-a-contender/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
{"article": "Michael Avenatti, who\u2019s representing porn star Stormy Daniels in her legal battle with President Donald Trump, dropped some interesting tidbits about the Russian attempts to use hackers to breach government, corporate and the private sector in the weeks leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nAvenatti alleges in a new CNN op-ed that the allegations about Russian hackers targeting the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign will be important for Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. In the op-ed, Avenatti notes that the Mueller investigation may well reveal the extent of the election interference attempts.\nThe op-ed quotes a confidential DNC document to suggest that hackers tapped into voter registration databases:\nThe hacking group known as Fancy Bear, which is linked to the Russian military intelligence services, targeted the Democratic National Committee [DNC] \u2014 as well as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the Clinton presidential campaign, state voter registration databases, and one political action committee targeting Republicans. Similar data breaches by Fancy Bear were publicly disclosed by the DCCC and the DNC in December 2016.\nYesterday, Mueller indicted 13 Russians, which included more than 30 top operatives, for meddling in the 2016 election. As the Post\u2019s Tom Hamburger explains:\nThe defendants allegedly worked with the Russian military intelligence services to plot cyberattacks on American political organizations and government agencies in the weeks and months before the presidential election last year. The defendants also posed as Americans online and hacked into Democratic Party networks, obtaining email messages, campaign secrets and other sensitive information.\nThe indictments were in response to a 12-count indictment, which Mueller unsealed in July, alleging that Russian hackers stole thousands of emails from Democratic organizations. That indictment also laid out a plan by Russian cyber-thieves to launch a \u201cspearphishing\u201d campaign on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email servers, which they said they hoped would convince people in the U.S. government to leak damaging information about her campaign.\nMueller has been investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This most recent indictment came after the FBI raided the house of Donald Trump Jr. in August to search for emails that he and Trump campaign aide Paul Manafort had exchanged with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n[graphiq id=\u201d8lRQZlzMY47\u2033 title=\u201dRussian Election Meddling \u2013 Wider Impact\u201d width=\u201d600\u2033 height=\u201d578\u2033 url=\u201dhttps://w.graphiq.com/w/8lRQZlzMY47\u2033 link=\u201dhttp://us-election-meddling.insidegov.com\u201d link_text=\u201dRussian Election Meddling \u2013 Wider Impact | InsideGov\u201d]\nUpdate: CNN\u2019s Eli Watkins who spoke with Mueller\u2019s team has not been dismissed, sources tell CNN.\n[featured story=\u201dTies between Russia, U.S. elections\u201d]\n", "domain": "techcrunch.com", "title": "Mueller report sheds new light on how the Russians hacked the DNC and the Clinton campaign \u2013 TechCrunch", "date": "April 18, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 4054, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/mueller-clinton-arizona-hack/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Everybody that has anything to do with inflation is saying it\u2019s Slade.\nIs inflation dead. In your opinion Jim Grant or is it just hibernating a bit. But you know that the Fed in a way. kind of a funny paradoxical way. It\u2019s me chasing its tail. The past ten years or so has been a time of Great. Credit for nation borrowing and lending corporate. Debt is way up. And. So if you look at. The restaurant there\u2019s this. Huge boom in restaurant construction. Of. Course. Very very. Easy. Credit conditions. And what this leads to finally today is 10 chicken nuggets and Burger King for dollars 49. Now that is an anti. Inflationary problem for the Fed. But it was the very interest rates that the Fed imposed. That. Helped to bring on this so-called problem. Actually for consumers. It\u2019s not a problem. But. Inflation isn\u2019t a problem for.\nPeople. It\u2019s mostly a problem for those that own. You know things that have. Depreciated to move lower in price. It\u2019s a way to inflate things especially financial assets. But in the end the question I want to ask is free markets are fair markets. Many were upset that the Fed and all central banks became Goliath\u2019s of the universe. And now that thing seem to be almost all time highs record for the same Fed. That is now data dependent to start managing interest rates again. How do you see.\nThat we need to free markets. Of course except it\u2019s not quite. Of course these days. But you know it\u2019s as if we were watching. A Cubs game. For example Africa. And. Everyone. Was talking about the umpires they could not stop marveling. At the umpires and what they might be thinking and what they might be doing. The hitters in the pictures. Kind of. Afterthought. So we are preoccupied by the people who. Make the rules and who change the rules. And. Who change. The. Currency. Within that set of rules. And I think we will arrive at a very good place when no one knows the name or the chairman of the Fed. That would be would be a fine thing. As it is now. That name is omnipresent. The Fed itself is certainly too much with us.\nYou know Jim I think that\u2019s a great place to leave it. I would just say the following. When people say we want to know what Fed policy is going to be they should think about what they are Aspe because the Fed should know much more than a good interest rate observer knows about future.\nFor more market trends, visit ETF Trends.\n", "domain": "etftrends.com", "title": "James Grant On The Fed Chasing Its Tail And Inflation", "date": "April 17, 2019", "authors": "Value Walk", "ind30k": 28810, "url": "https://www.etftrends.com/fixed-income-channel/james-grant-on-the-fed-chasing-its-tail-and-inflation/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.4642735166739626}
{"article": "If only every basketball fan got a chance to sit in Al Jefferson's chair for one minute.\n\"I will tell you, you've got to sit behind that chair,\" the forward told his former teammates at the Alamo City Athletic Club's basketball and barbecue event in 2010. \"I'll even make sure you get the closest seat.\"\nThe postgame seating privilege afforded to Jefferson was one of the little bits of interesting tidbits David Corliss incorporated into his book about the Utah Jazz's history, \"100 Things Jazz Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die.\"\nAnother thing we learned about the 30-year-old Jefferson:\nHe loves Michael Jordan. (Talk about King M.J.)\nJefferson, who played seven seasons with the Jazz after being a top-flight pick of the Charlotte Bobcats in 2006, will forever be remembered in Utah as one of the few who fought with superstar Carlos Boozer in the 2008 brawl at the American Airlines Center.\nBut Jefferson says his basketball impressions of the 6-foot-9 Bulls star \u2014 the photo evidence that's sure to show up in Sports Illustrated if Jordan's departure from Chicago is indeed imminent \u2014 are nothing like the poster-sized, one-on-one matchup pictures in his \"100 Things\" book.\n\"To me, [Jordan] is all over the place,\" Jefferson said. \"He's strong. He's fast. He's quick. He's got an arm span like no other. He reminds me a lot of Spider-Man.\"\nBig Al's favorite Jordan moment, though, had more to do with humility.\n\"I've always had a liking for when he comes to All-Star Game and when he actually gives an interview and he's like, 'Hey, I'll give you whatever the guys are throwing at me or whatever the official has put in their rules. That's something that separates me from everybody,\" Jefferson said. \"I feel like we just have a different mentality of when we play hard \u2014 when we get hit hard \u2014 we're not going to talk a lot. We're going to go out there and compete and play. That's what I admire the most about him.\"\nThis next tidbit about Jefferson may have you disappointed if you've spent the past year expecting Corliss to dive right into his message about learning Jazz culture. It's not a one-way street. Jefferson shared a few touching memories with the now Jazz correspondent, too.\nBut for everybody else, here are 100 things about the Jazz that, collectively, make a pretty strong case that \"Utah Jazz Name & Style are finally getting it right!\"\n1. The Jazz nickname is awesome. Some fans still disagree.\n2. The Jazz get it. They're hoping the RingPac saga is ending.\n3. Ditto. (Or, well, wasn't it?)\n4. Gordon Hayward is a great sports storyteller.\n5. Utah fans still think the team is better than the Boston Celtics. \"I think that's where we're going,\" Hayward said.\n6. It turns out John Stockton can still play basketball, too. \"I think he got his swagger back,\" Hayward said.\n7. Sloan was as down-to-earth as they come. \"He made us feel at home,\" said a confident Hayward.\n8. The Jazz franchise has a great history.\n9. Where's Jerry Sloan? Fans want the 77-year-old coach back.\n10. Hayward wears gray for almost no reason. Like, not really at all.\n11. Jefferson still thinks a Big Al T-shirt with the \"G\" for the legendary Gordan Hayward was too popular.\n12. Kevin O'Connor is a mensch. Jazz fans love him.\n13. Utah took Hayward over Memphis. \"I don't know that I ever would have agreed to go to Memphis,\" Hayward said.\n14. The Jazz are making adjustments on the fly. There's a fine line between being ruthless and cruel, and the Jazz still make tough choices.\n15. Trey Burke and Alec Burks sure are a lot alike. \"They have the same crazy, running nature,\" said Hayward, adding, \"they're completely different people.\"\n16. The Jazz have a spot for fans who think they were overlooked in their playbooks. \"Go have a ball,\" Hayward said.\n17. It's time to let go of Carlos Boozer. \"That's a battle that goes on forever, and that's going to keep on going forever,\" Hayward said.\n18. Each year, so many fans say they want to attend a Jazz-hosted Jazz Night at the Delta Center. That's why the team bought out Boozer and Andrei Kirilenko.\n19.

To stay mentally stable and stay focused for practice and the longer days can help a lot with a young team.\u201d\nWilson and Theoret, who trains with Calgary Synchro and Banff Aquatic and Leisure Centre, will compete in the junior varsity competition tonight. A senior synchronized gold medal will clinch Wilson\u2019s entry to the grand finals of a world championship.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can stop now,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI think I need to try every weekend out and compete in a junior varsity event just to get over the anxiety of nationals.\u201d\nShe completed a pool scholarship at South High School in Seattle and began working with Filliereau at 18.

{"article": "How about this for an idea: a digital entertainment platform which can stream high-quality content from a remote data center to any device, anywhere in the world. Sound familiar? How about one step further, offering spectators the chance to either sit back and watch or jump straight into the screen.\nEnter Google Stadia. The announcement of the tech giant\u2019s new cloud gaming service may look initially as the Netflix model for gamers, delivering digital game entertainment to the masses, followed closely by April\u2019s announcement of \u201cStart\u201d from Chinese tech giant Tencent, who similarly offer to put high-quality gaming within the reach of any device, at any time, through the cloud.\nBut there\u2019s a major development. Stadia is promising to give you the complete free will to either sit back and spectate people all over the world playing live games or deciding to get involved and play too \u2014 all in real time. Everyone could be a protagonist in what could be the greatest show on earth.\nWhen I first started working in games development, it was a much more solitary experience which grew exciting when we moved into multi-player modes and you could invite friends over to play together. Then came X-Box\u2019s release of Halo and suddenly you could play against someone on the other side of the world, on consoles instead of PC. Although tech lagged and it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing, the Halo effect was transformative. With the rise of sites like YouTube and Twitch, a parallel trend was a rise in people keen to spectate gaming as a sport, watching impressive players online as they went from level to level. Now Google wants to combine these behaviors and give people the choice on whether to watch or play.\nCurrently, a player\u2019s gaming experiences are usually defined by what physical equipment you have. Whether it is through a console or a PC, users have to invest in expensive hardware to get a high-quality gaming experience. Stadia promises to disrupt this status quo entirely \u2014 allowing players to stream games that are being powered on Google\u2019s servers.\nSounds too good to be true, right? It will be down to the technical capability and content quality to decide.\nMade for mobile?\nFor Netflix, the streaming model is relatively simple as it does not require interaction beyond choosing what you want to watch, whereas a gaming streaming service like Stadia will require an infinitely more complex level of interaction between server and user, with Stadia having to respond to constant user inputs in real-time speed. The speed and stability of Stadia\u2019s streaming will be fundamental to it succeeding.\nThis represents a huge technical challenge \u2014 but if any company is equipped to undertake such a task, it is likely Google. Google already has a huge global infrastructure of more than 400,000 miles of fiber-optic cables linking its data centers around the world and has developed compression algorithms which shrink the size of data files to allow more information to be transmitted on a lower bandwidth.\nDespite this, users will still be dependent on their home internet service provider, or their 4G connection from a mobile provider. Google has stated that \u201cto get 1080p, 60-frames-per-second, required approximately 25 megabits per second (Mbps). In fact, we use less than that, but that\u2019s where we put our recommended limit at.\u201d For most broadband connections, this is a reasonable speed of connectivity to expect; however, it raises questions for the mobile capacity for Stadia.\nThe average 4G connection has a download speed of between 5Mbps and 12Mbps, which is less than half of the required speed for Stadia. This does not factor in the significant amount of regions that are still limited to 3G coverage \u2014 which is 10 times slower than a 4G connection. It would seem then that a large part of Stadia being accessible to mobile devices would depend on the roll out of 5G coverage, which still appears to be years away from widespread public use.\nTo offer a truly mobile experience, in its current form Stadia may be too fast for the infrastructure that supports it.\nQuestions on content?\nStadia raises even more interesting questions about the future of gaming content. A key indicator of what the next generation of gaming will look like depends largely on how Google attempt to price its product. Speculation is that Stadia will be a subscription-based model \u2013 disrupting the existing model and undoubtedly having an effect on gamers, developers and publishers alike.\nThe bigger players who create specifically for the platform will get a lot of attention for their games which could make it a trickier landscape for independent developers to be seen \u2013 but equally it\u2019s an opportunity for these businesses to adapt. The likes of Sony and Microsoft will also want to maintain their dominance in the console market and protect their audience of gamers who enjoy their consoles and plugging in. But the exciting aspect is that it\u2019s another route to market for content creators and ultimately the more avenues available to connect creators with consumers can only be a good thing.\nI think Stadia is another example of a growing trend in all aspects of media and entertainment; the importance of the medium is diminishing. Audiences want to have the best and broadest choice of content possible \u2013 how that content is delivered is increasingly less relevant. This makes an interesting shift from the war of exclusives we have seen on consoles in particular, which created an almost tribal divide between Xbox and PlayStation players.\nFor Stadia this means two things: firstly, that the key to its success will be having a vast encyclopedia of content available \u2013 you wonder how keen Sony or Microsoft would be to hand over access to their exclusive titles to a competitor. Secondly, if it wants to bring the Netflix model to gaming, it must understand that users are not always loyal to the platform itself and the best content will surely win out, wherever it is.\nStadia is an exciting glimpse into the future of our relationship with games \u2014 but it must answer some decisive questions around connectivity and content ahead of its launch later this year. If it can address these concerns, then it could really make a splash.\nJason Kingsley is co-founder and CEO of game developer Rebellion.\n", "domain": "venturebeat.com", "title": "Google\u2019s Stadia bet: Breaking barriers \u2014 if the games and tech can support it", "date": "April 11, 2019", "authors": "Jason Kingsley", "ind30k": 23068, "url": "https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/11/googles-stadia-bet-breaking-barriers-if-the-games-and-tech-can-support-it/", "label": "human", "orig_split": "train_burner", "split": "test", "random_score": 0.47959343255688863}

{"article": "I know this sounds paradoxical, but I haven't touched my Apple AirPods since they were released in late 2016.\nI've used the new wireless earbuds from Apple, and got them in their most basic white and black versions, since those first few days after they debuted. Then, they all but disappeared from my life.\nLong story short: There are a couple reasons why I haven't returned.\nOne, I use my old headphones for everything. I was used to them. They're easy to use, sturdy and mostly fine, so they held their own when my Apple AirPods couldn't. I still used them even when the current \"phone cases\" arrived last October, and the new model arrived late last month, too.\nI no longer used my $75 case ($50 after rebate). Most of the time, I just left my old case in the purse when I left the house.\nThese had better sound!\nI think this is actually why I've not returned the AirPods to Apple. They're excellent, but since I got used to my earbuds, I haven't noticed any sonic difference. With my old stuff, they might sound a little more \"premium\" or \"omnidirectional.\" The difference is subtle. My ears also didn't seem to be especially sensitive when they were plugged in, as I would be with Apple's $159 Lightning charging case, though one friend told me that she'd lose the cord completely in between takes. There's a neat small clip on the back of the case for keeping it tight.\nThey're easy to remove.\nPossibly the biggest reason: the ability to keep them in your ear while working, driving or other use, which I didn't have with my old black, $150 pair of leather headphones. The new white and black models seemed to work well.\nThe thing is, as excited as I am to start using AirPods with my iPhone 7, I still really like my old ones. The original AirPods were a major source of joy, and I appreciated having them tied directly to my Apple phone. They may not seem totally obsolete, but that's where my trustiness with my old headphones makes them feel that way.\nAirPods are still too expensive.\nAirPods may be something people need, but at $159 a pop, it's a new product for an iPhone crowd that loves other bands like AirDroids and Farfetch -- it's more expensive than AirDroids, Beats and the much-hyped Flypods from the House of Jordan.\nJohn P. Falcone/CNET\nFor the price, I believe Apple should've done more for the $69 case ($30 after rebate) too. I'd hate to pay a premium for both cases when they're the same thing. The black case, if the new color wasn't on their packaging, I never saw, and the same thing happened with the white, which I never felt was that dramatically different from my black. And the $39 AirPort mini router has long been a no-show, though I know it should have been in the box, too. That means one scenario: I didn't buy both Apple wireless earbuds and the case. That felt both to me as a consumer and a reporter, cynical and all.\nIf the people you'll be sending money to are AirPods enthusiasts, you can probably buy one of those for cheap. It'll still sound amazing, and the case likely adds more battery life.\nI haven't seen much improvement in the sound.\nHow badly do you want new Apple wireless earbuds? If these are going to be the only earbuds you use, they're expensive.\nEditors' note, April 3, 2017: This story originally published on March 18, 2016.

It's a \"framework\".\nWith climate change, if we do nothing, we'll die.\nAnd if we do nothing, it might be too late. But we might also have a basis to get off of it.\nIt's more or less a sham. But Coalition has painted itself into a fiscal corner\nIf, in the event of a Coalition win in the next few weeks, the Coalition defeats Labor in the election, it will have to find $300 billion in cuts to the budget to get the budget back to surplus.\nThe Coalition has painted itself into a budget corner. In its own words, it's not a plan at all. It's just a \"framework\".\nHere's how the Coalition should pitch climate policy in an election:\nWe don't believe in climate change, and we don't want to tax you if you don't believe in climate change, too. We think it's a distraction and it will get us nowhere. I mean, look at this National Climate Change Bill \u2014 it's just an expensive load of fuel that nobody really uses. The rest of you vote for Labor \u2014 it's a waste of time.\nThe broad idea of moving away from economic research and to something called market-based science hasn't been discussed during the election campaign, in any real sense.\nBut the argument has been made again and again in the media.\nImagine if all politicians were like the Coalition about climate change.\nEvery Labor leader and shadow treasurer who was denied an election win would pledge to move Australia off the Paris target of reducing global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\nThe idea would be that they would take their time, stick to it, and stick it to the Coalition.\nWarm words don't hurt the Coalition any more than cold ones, but the Coalition has painted itself into a fiscal corner.\nForget about the polling: The social media studies are clear\nThe emissions trading scheme was supposed to be done in Labor's first term. And Abbott has built an entire policy platform on not doing it.\nThis election needs to be about election promises. The social media studies are clear. The most popular promises are the ones about either paying down debt or raising wages.\nAnd promises about climate change that see people on the left wailing about how stupid we are or the economy will fall apart are seen as the only the very worst thing in politics.\nThey all know that the carbon tax will be gone and even without a clean energy target, every poll tells them that Australians want action on climate change.\nAnd so there's pressure on the opposition to make a concrete policy that goes beyond just slamming it on the Climate Change Authority.\nIt's not just the pollies either. The Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, has put out \"a carbon price,\" rather than a manifesto of policies on climate change.\nIt's easy to mock the idea, but it's serious and it's happening \u2014 with Labor rapidly regaining ground, only one week out from the election.\nAnyone thinking to paraphrase Mark Latham's cartoon could see a future in which Australia moves from a level playing field for every one, including big polluters, to a cap-and-trade scheme.\nAnd that's because the Coalition has just painted itself into a position where it will take years to restore its political position.\nThe truth is, climate change can no longer be dismissed as a hoax.\nAustralia is no longer \"the silly season\".\nEvery second week, if you Google Australia and climate change, there's a story about the impact.\nTopics: federal-elections, government-and-politics, emissions-trading, emissions-trading, mining-industry, business-economics-and-finance, regional-development, climate-change, australia\nFirst posted\n", "domain": "abc.net.au", "title": "The Coalition has painted itself into a fiscal corner, just like it has on climate change", "date": "April 06, 2019", "authors": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "ind30k": 8567, "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-06/the-biggest-challenge-facing-shorten-and-morrison-is-you/10976112", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

Last year Ellen King Reed came in and offered to rent it out for a same-sex wedding. Reed, who is gay, says she asked the Panncin family to allow her to marry her partner Virginia Williams in a barn a short distance from their home.\n\"It was important to be able to get married in my own community,\" King Reed said.\nKing Reed was initially approved by the Panncin family. She has been renting the barn on Saturdays for weddings, receptions and private parties for a year.

NBC10 spoke with Deputy Commissioner Janet Woit.\n\"We don't generally hear about a case,\" Woit said. \"But it is likely that that there will be a hearing.\"\nWoit added the commission doesn't rule on cases like these.

In nursing homes, nursing-home residents and patients with weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable.\nThat\u2019s why they and others in similar settings are susceptible to any infection carried by others in their immediate environment, including health care workers and visitors, Smith said.\nFollowing are the five things experts said the public should know about these outbreaks:\n1. Door-to-door services to go\nLike it or not, health care workers can unwittingly spread infections, especially in long-term care facilities.\nCMS said in 2013 that half of nursing home residents \u2014 all those in intermediate care facilities \u2014 had some form of infected hand-to-mouth contact with workers. Many of them were hospitalized in recent years with infections, even including hospital-acquired infections.\nAs the outbreak grew, CMS in 2015 said all nursing home residents should receive hand hygiene recommendations and regularly get them if they live in a unit with a two-care nurse.\nCMS has received around 10 reports of the fungus infections from Illinois in the past two years, said Mike Neeta, who serves on the board of the Illinois Department of Public Health\u2019s division of communicable disease control.\n2. Microscopic threats\nCMS determined that the fungus is present in three nursing homes in Illinois. It\u2019s found in other areas around the country, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Missouri, New Jersey, Washington and Indiana.\nThe exact locations of the residences and the types of patients and residents affected vary.\n\u201cWe are trying to determine exactly what is causing the outbreaks,\u201d Neeta said.\n\u201cMore outbreaks are happening\u201d nationally, Smith said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super-rare bacteria,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think more outbreaks are happening just because more people live in confined areas.\u201d\nOne of the most vulnerable people, for example, is an elderly person with congestive heart failure, who has a weakened immune system and may have trouble controlling a blood infection.\n3. Antibiotic resistance\nWhen these infections are diagnosed and treated, hospitals sometimes administer antibiotics too aggressively. When the bacteria are then resistant to those drugs, some were soon not even treated at all.\n\u201cThe problem [has] been able to grow to the point where we can\u2019t cure [infections],\u201d Smith said.\n4. Swiping\nThere\u2019s no cleanliness level that eliminates the spores.\nSo frequent checks on surfaces for the spores are helpful. But infections don\u2019t spread as easily among people as they can between bacteria.\nNursing homes need to devote more time to cleaning, and stay vigilant even when they can\u2019t detect the fungi, Smith said.\nThey also need to be ahead of outbreaks, he said.\nThat also can help prevent outbreaks from happening in the first place.\n\u201cAs soon as something is being put out to the community, that\u2019s an early warning,\u201d Smith said.\n5. How do you treat a flu-like illness that lasts a few days but still causes symptoms?\nClostridium difficile \u2014 C. diff \u2014 often comes on quickly and goes away easily.\nBut the illness is also serious and takes long spells of time to recover.\nSome think the answer is the same treatment that has been effective for so many other medically deadly infections.\n\u201cThe old response was \u2018Everything\u2019s about antibiotic resistance,\u2019 \u201d Smith said. \u201cSo a very rapid treatment protocol is very helpful.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not necessarily the", "domain": "suntimes.com", "title": "Deadly fungus hitting care facilities around Chicago: 5 things to know", "date": "April 12, 2019", "authors": "Stephanie Zimmermann", "ind30k": 712, "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/well/candida-auris-fungus-deadly-infection-spreading-chicago-hotspot-key-facts-health-guide/", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}

{"article": "On Wednesday, former President Clinton told one story about Joe Biden and another about the latter's latest brush with a snitch in Georgia. Then he dropped the ball.\n\u201cWe just finished up that big meeting with Joe Biden \u2026 that brought him into our campaign,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be with the president every day.\u201d\nIt was a funny bit in an evening crammed with jokes, riffs, and pokes at the president. But then the laugh track went dead. Clinton should have held the mic.\nA former presidential candidate and vice-president, Vice President Biden served as president Clinton\u2019s equal in the White House in the 1990s. Clinton delivered it as if Biden were standing behind him, says David Corn, congressional bureau chief for Mother Jones magazine.\nBut Biden's \u201cbrute strength and his willingness to take on anyone, including his own party, is rare in Washington,\u201d says Mr. Corn.\nBiden served as secretary of State in Clinton\u2019s administration, and was his running mate in the 1992 presidential election. After his two terms in the Senate, Biden ran for president in 1988, and failed. He went on to vice president, first under Clinton, then Obama.\nIn the meantime, Clinton ended up with one of the best jobs in government, two terms as the 42nd president of the United States. Which is why Clinton is probably surprised at the how close and frequent jokes he hears about Biden.\nOne was when Clinton hugged Biden and wished him a happy 70th birthday, which the vice president turned in February. In the past, Clinton often embraced Biden on stage at high-profile Democratic fundraisers. And Clinton has been known to mention Biden\u2019s name at the end of speeches he gives. In a speech on climate change to the National Democratic Club in January, Clinton hailed Biden as \u201cthe best friend I ever had.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Biden spent most of his 13-minute speech telling his life story, from his childhood in Scranton, Pa., through his time in Delaware and serving in the Senate, and as his party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 1992.\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever been around Joe Biden has been touched by him \u2013 literally,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D) of New York at the beginning of Biden\u2019s speech.\nFor a man who once rode to victory in the Delaware primary in a 1970s fire engine, and at another time nearly became vice president himself, Biden sounds downright choked up at times. The life story is rich with stories of working-class Americans, the Jewish family of his hometown in Scranton, and the others he worked with in the Senate and that he picked up along the way.\nThe speaker\u2019s intent is to raise money for the Biden family and to give Democrats and other Americans reason to pay attention to the vice president. Biden is the kind of vice president who raises money by charming donors. That would not be a problem if there was no story line.\nBut Biden\u2019s version of the vice presidency was noted by Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky, who used his introductory remarks to attack Biden for his handling of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack. And the latest story is coming from the staff of his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer earlier this year.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

{"article": "NEWARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 One of the NHL\u2019s biggest stars remained sidelined for more than three months after his knee injury, but the New Jersey Devils insisted it wasn\u2019t a serious injury even after doctors were pessimistic and told the center he could be done for the season.\nTaylor Hall wasn\u2019t sure at first either, but tried to finish the season with the Devils.\nNow he is certain.\nHall said Monday night he tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee during the second period of a game on March 7. He had season-ending surgery Monday.\nIt was the same knee he injured in a fight with Colorado\u2019s Philipp Grubauer during a game on Dec. 29.\nHall, who led the Devils with 27 goals, said doctors didn\u2019t believe it was a serious injury until it got to the knee of a general surgeon. It then became a long road to recovery.\n\u201cHe had the same surgery and he didn\u2019t think it was anything,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThen the knee got into the general surgeon\u2019s knee, the guy that I would go see and I hadn\u2019t had the surgery done yet, it\u2019s almost like they had a disagreement on that. I knew right then that I would be out a while.\u201d\nThe 24-year-old Hall has one year left on a deal worth $8.5 million. He also received a season-ending, 18-game suspension for his brawl with Grubauer in Colorado.\nHall is expected to play this season under a different contract.\nHe said he believes he will be back to form next season, and by then the Devils may be even better than they were before they lost in the first round of the playoffs to Pittsburgh after capturing the Atlantic Division.\nThe Devils were a surprising ninth in the Eastern Conference with 56 points. Injuries, including a high ankle sprain suffered by rookie defenseman Damon Severson and a broken bone in forward Marcus Johansson\u2019s foot, hindered them.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to talk to a couple guys in different places, they really believe they\u2019re going to be better next year and they\u2019re not afraid to think that way,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI was just really thankful to be able to finish the season. I was kind of afraid I was going to be done for the year but I feel like next year and my contract is going to be a lot better than it was this year.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2013Sports\n", "domain": "foxsports.com", "title": "Cause of Taylor Hall\u2019s knee injury evaded doctors for months", "date": "April 08, 2019", "authors": null, "ind30k": 1405, "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/story/cause-of-taylor-hall-s-knee-injury-evaded-doctors-for-months-040819", "label": "machine", "orig_split": "gen", "top_p": 0.9396825396825397, "split": "test"}
